Although I\u2019m still at the very beginning of my career I\u2019ve already had incredible experiences thanks to the fact I was always involved with <strong>volunteering<\/strong> and activist organizations from a very young age.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My passion for volunteering and changing the world is as old as my passion for <strong>design<\/strong>, so it only makes sense<strong> I believe I can join both<\/strong> in one way or another.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Like father like son<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I think a big part of telling you my blogging and personal story is related to the relationship I have with my dad \u2013<strong> he\u2019s awesome!<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although not present in most of childhood he was and is a great parent, example and leader, he was the one who initially years ago <strong>made me want to become a designer<\/strong>, although to be honest at the time I didn\u2019t knew it at all. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me explain &#8211; my father has worked for the biggest printers in Portugal such as Lidergraf and Naveprinter as one of the very best printers they had.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So as the story goes, one day my mom decided to take me to visit my dad late at work and this was basically <strong>officially the first time I fell in love with design<\/strong> as he showed me the huge rolls of paper, proofs of what he was printing, pantone reference books and of course the magnifying lens they use for proofing the projects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking back to it now as I\u2019m writing this it\u2019s funny how life has turned out and how we basically have a bunch of topics to talk about and we even could work together at the same company. It\u2019s truly as the saying goes \u2013 <strong>like father like son<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The boy who dreamed<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m such a huge dreamer and I\u2019m not telling you this lightly <strong>I truly have a big relationship with dreaming.<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It makes me happy knowing that even if I can\u2019t sometimes make all my dreams happen, I still continue to push new dreams into the equation,<strong> it\u2019s a big part of who I am and what defines me.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I was young, I would frequently imagine the world in the future, besides the fact that I thought flying cars would be around already I also dreamt about a different society than what we have now. A <strong>fairer, more equal world<\/strong> where humans would co-exist \u2013 no wars, no homelessness, no discrimination.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps I dreamt and still dream too high but, in many ways, I hope to die knowing the world that little Hugo imagined was not just a mere dream.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Design = Change<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of my goals as a <strong>designer who cares about the world <\/strong>that surrounds him is to show that design has changed the world and can change the world, making it a better place. Although this isn\u2019t the main reason why I\u2019ve started this blog it hopefully helps to explain my thought process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Design = Change<\/strong> is eventually one of my ultimate long-term dreams turned goals that I see culminating in a book about design for social change, the blog definitely helps with my writing situation but this is a long-term idea and concept that I want to explore.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So hopefully now that you know<strong> <\/strong>a part of<strong> my story<\/strong> you can see what I mean and expand upon this concept in your own blogging story, but I still have to explain you why I started and how you can start right now &#8211; stay tuned!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why I began a blog?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Well now we are reaching to an interesting part of my blogging story, so let me tell you how I started so we can get to the good part where I tell you how you can start <strong>right now!<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently I finished my bachelor\u2019s degree in graphic design and after trying and failing to move to another country and get into a design agency (I will release an article about this one day) I stayed in Portugal and I\u2019m now doing a nine-month internship in a multinational company at their marketing department, alongside this I\u2019m kickstarting my own design studio (it&#8217;s still in early development).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This blog is in many ways a way for me to <strong>express myself<\/strong>, to <strong>share my struggles<\/strong>, to <strong>inspire<\/strong> and hopefully one day to <strong>achieve a certain level of establishment<\/strong> like the designers I respect and are inspired by. Hey maybe one day I\u2019m even invited to talk at a TED talk or an event \u2013 <strong>the sky isn\u2019t the limit for this dreamer!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also in a day and age where short-form copy paste mindless boring content is the mainstream on social media and other platforms, <strong>writing a blog feels truly refreshing.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How I started and how you start a blog now<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you want to start your own blog? Don\u2019t worry this is going to be my <strong>nonsense guide on how the hell I figured this out <\/strong>so the only thing stopping you from writing a blog about your mom\u2019s cookies online is yourself, also a disclaimer, I\u2019m not talking about stuff that you can easily watch in one of the videos I\u2019m going to link bellow like \u201cHow to make a website with WordPress\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">First you will need to figure out two easy things<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Figure out what you want to talk about<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Figure out if you are using a platform for blogs or if you are making it from scratch<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Figuring out what you are going to talk about should be the easy first step,<strong> just write about something that excites you<\/strong>. You love to cook with your mom? Write about that! You love to walk your dog? Write about that! <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s easy <strong>just find something you love and write about that<\/strong>, on my own case I knew I wanted to talk about design and stuff related about design because guess what, it\u2019s what I love \u2013 easy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Choosing a platform becomes the <strong>pain the ass<\/strong> to be honest thanks to the increasing variety of platforms that exist on the market, so it\u2019s genuinely going to <strong>need some research on your part<\/strong> but here is a small compilation of my own process and conclusions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.blogger.com\/\"><strong>Blogger<\/strong><\/a> if you want something incredibly easy but without much customization (also free if you don\u2019t connect your own domain)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/\">Medium<\/a> <\/strong>as either your main option or something secondary where you import your blog posts to hopefully generate more traffic<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Build your own website with a powerful CMS, you have thousands of options here from <a href=\"http:\/\/squarespace.com\"><strong>squarespace<\/strong><\/a> to <a href=\"http:\/\/wix.com\"><strong>wix<\/strong><\/a> to <a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.com\"><strong>wordpress<\/strong><\/a>, it\u2019s like the multiverse \u2013 infinite options.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">My current setup consists of a domain bought through <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cloudflare.com\/\"><strong>cloudflare<\/strong><\/a> pointing towards a <a href=\"https:\/\/vrlps.co\/edsm8ck\/cp\"><strong>cloudways<\/strong><\/a> server with a <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/\"><strong>wordpress<\/strong><\/a> installation.<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m not going to touch on what plugins I\u2019m using and stuff like that because wordpress is a <strong>build your own scenario<\/strong> platform so it doesn\u2019t make sense.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some notes on my setup though, first <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cloudflare.com\/\"><strong>cloudflare<\/strong><\/a> has a small problem if you are on the completely free tier and you buy a domain with them \u2013 <strong>you cannot point to other nameservers.<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This wasn\u2019t a problem on my use case because I wanted to <strong>run my DNS towards <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cloudflare.com\/\">cloudflare<\/a> anyways <\/strong>but it excluded some web hosting providers that for some reason only were allowing me to add this domain if I changed my nameservers. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, this is probably not the cheapest solution but it works for me as I wanted to <strong>host two websites in the same server<\/strong>, my studio\u2019s website which I haven\u2019t made yet and my blog. Third<strong> I\u2019m not a web developer<\/strong> so this setup probably isn\u2019t the best \u2013 <strong>do your research!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also I\u2019m using google analytics, google search console and <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cloudflare.com\/\">cloudflare<\/a><\/strong> to analyze website performance and gmail\u2019s API for the emails that get routed from the contact form (this was a pain to setup). In the future I\u2019m also considering adding google ads in a non-intrusive way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">On a final note, I just wanted to tell that<strong> I\u2019m excited<\/strong> to write here and that you can of course expect me to keep you updated! More stuff about the studio coming soon!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of posting frequency, you can expect <strong>1 \u2013 3 articles per week<\/strong>, sometimes more sometimes less, let\u2019s go with the flow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, if you want more content, please do consider checking out my <strong>social media<\/strong> platforms! Feel free to also leave a comment, I will try to read them all!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for reading, I hope you enjoyed my blogging story, understood how I started and hopefully got some motivation and knowledge on how you can start right now!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also contact me through <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/design-hugo.com\/contact\/\">here<\/a>!<\/strong> I&#8217;ll try to answer to emails as soon as possible!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Some links (non-affiliate):<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>freeCodeCamp<\/strong>: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9VPq1JxMfkA&amp;ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org\">How to Make a WordPress Blog and Website \u2013 Tutorial for Beginners 2022<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cloudflare.com\/\"><strong>cloudflare<\/strong><\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/vrlps.co\/edsm8ck\/cp\">cloudways<\/a><\/strong> &#8211; Get $25 free hosting credit by signing up with my link.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you are reading this hello there!
