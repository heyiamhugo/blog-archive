I\u2019ve met a few people who have done work like this and it bothers me on a whole new level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Personally, I have the standard non-bridge Formula Guide set which I bought before the whole Adobe and Pantone situation which led to the dreadful implementation of Pantone Connect. If you are acquiring your Pantone catalogs now, I recommend you to get the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Pantone-Bridge-Guides-Coated-Uncoated\/dp\/B0BY9QWBWF\/ref=sr_1_15?keywords=pantone+color+bridge&amp;qid=1698498734&amp;sr=8-15&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=hugosnotes-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=ad4d4d1ca1f00f696427323ce9856d63&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325\"><strong>Pantone Formula Guide Bridge Coated &amp; Uncoated set,<\/strong><\/a> so you don\u2019t have issues when picking colors for projects where you need CMYK and RGB values.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, a quick tip Pantone on the back of their Formula guide sets claim they last for only a year, <strong>if you preserve your guides in a dark environment with no humidity, they will last you years. <\/strong>One of my teachers showed us her guides with 40+ years of use, the colors were mostly perfect. Think about it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CMY color wheel<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"845\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/design-hugo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/cmy-color-wheel-845x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-170\" srcset=\"https:\/\/design-hugo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/cmy-color-wheel-845x1024.jpg 845w, https:\/\/design-hugo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/cmy-color-wheel-248x300.jpg 248w, https:\/\/design-hugo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/cmy-color-wheel-768x931.jpg 768w, https:\/\/design-hugo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/cmy-color-wheel.jpg 1238w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 845px) 100vw, 845px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This item was also recommended by a teacher and it took me years to find it online being sold again. It\u2019s a color wheel that helps you figure out color combinations, there\u2019s also an <a href=\"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.cmycolorwheel.cmy&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US\"><strong>app that I would recommend for Android<\/strong><\/a> that I used previously. To be honest, if you can buy a physical version of the wheel, it\u2019s cheap and feels better than the one on your phone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This color wheel is very well printed with a fair amount of accuracy and attention to detail which is also important. Using a color wheel is in my opinion an<strong> essential part of my workflow <\/strong>and an inexpensive incredibly useful tool.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Also, if you don\u2019t want to get the one from the link I provided, make sure you get a CMY color wheel, don\u2019t get a RYB color wheel.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The RYB color wheel was created in the <strong>early days of color theory when we did not know about the existence of pigments Cyan and Magenta <\/strong>which are nowadays the standard for printing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The RYB color wheel unfortunately is still taught in a lot of schools and even universities,<\/strong> even a lot of design books still teach that model and subsequently there are a lot of wheels around that follow the RYB model, while it\u2019s great for painting it\u2019s awful for design, just remember that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/COLOR-WHEEL-COMPANY-BOOK\/dp\/B004YDDBM8\/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3MQHGV8RTE4WP&amp;keywords=cmy+color+wheel&amp;qid=1698499645&amp;sprefix=cmy+color+wheel%252Caps%252C167&amp;sr=8-3&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=hugosnotes-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=46d3450a3c81e453942643919efc1477&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325\"><strong>Basically, make sure you buy a CMY color wheel<\/strong><\/a><strong> <\/strong>which is much more useful and updated. Also, a huge thank you to Professor Dulce for teaching this and explaining it in detail, happy to have learned from you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ergonomic Chair<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/design-hugo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/my-back.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-158\" style=\"aspect-ratio:1.7777777777777777;width:751px;height:auto\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t be like <strong>Spiderman <\/strong>get a good quality chair. I\u2019m going to be honest with you here I don\u2019t have any specific recommendation to give you since everybody is different, but there are a few tips I can give you:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Forget about gaming chairs<\/strong> most of them are offensively bad for your posture, racing chairs are for racing not for you to be looking at a monitor 8h per day.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>If it\u2019s very cheap the materials are probably not that great, <strong>consider getting fewer features<\/strong> to save money instead of losing on material quality.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>I really like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hEC4wn6ayaY&amp;ab_channel=BTODtv\"><strong>this video<\/strong><\/a> comparing chairs, I think you should watch it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Every person is different but maintaining a good posture is a universal thing, I also recommend you to do a lot of breaks and frequent exercise. <strong>There is no chair on the market that will fix any of these issues for you.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Good mouse and keyboard<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img

paper catalogs.<\/strong> I absolutely don\u2019t understand why people don\u2019t talk about these more often they are <strong>essential tools for anyone working with any type of physical stuff<\/strong> they need to design. Business cards, books, magazines, and newspapers all need one thing \u2013 paper!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, a catalog is by far one of the most useful tools you can have around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My recommendation is to first check local print manufacturers, in Portugal, we have <a href=\"https:\/\/inapaportugal.pt\/\"><strong>Inapa,<\/strong><\/a> for example. These are probably the most common types of papers that your printers provide. Beyond this I would recommend two paper manufacturer catalogs \u2013 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.metapaper.io\/en\/paper\/sample-book\/\"><strong>Metapaper\u2019s Sample Book<\/strong><\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/fedrigoni.com\/en\/news\/paper-box-fedrigoni-paper\/\"><strong>Fedrigoni\u2019s Paper Box.<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Out of these two<strong> Fedrigoni\u2019s paper box<\/strong> is the most complete although it is a paid product and unfortunately currently is slightly outdated since they have removed some products.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a nice customer experience with them and you can request any paper samples you want from their website for free! <strong>They are very considerate!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">On a final note I wanted to just tell you that tools are just tools, without the knowledge you can have the best laptop and not be an amazing designer, skills come first \u2013 don\u2019t be a gearhead.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you liked this article please comment below!
