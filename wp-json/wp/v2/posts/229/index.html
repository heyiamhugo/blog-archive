Most of my readers have been friends and random online strangers which I\u2019m very grateful for! Seriously <strong>reading the few comments I got and seeing people interact with whatever I posted was genuinely awesome<\/strong> and I hope it just continues to grow onwards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although I want to be honest with you, I write not because I\u2019m looking for approval or adoring fans but rather as a therapy for my creative mind \u2013 seriously.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Nowadays mindless content being pushed into our dopamine-filled heads is almost a day-to-day guarantee, so being able to slow down and write about whatever goes on in my mind is awesome.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>But anyway, if you haven\u2019t read <a href=\"https:\/\/design-hugo.com\/my-blogging-story-why-i-started-and-how-you-can-start-right-now\/\"><strong>my very first article,<\/strong><\/a> I would recommend it as I go into why I started blogging and how you can also start your own thing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today\u2019s article is in many ways <strong>a follow up, <\/strong>what are the lessons that I learnt from my first month blogging? Well in this article I\u2019m going to share with you, fellow reader, 5 <strong>important things bloggers need to know.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1 \u2013 Besides you, no one cares<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I previously mentioned the impact of the current state of content and how blogging could be a refuge in this modern-day dopamine apocalypse,<strong> the truth is that fewer people are going to read whatever you write <\/strong>\u2013 consequences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To me, this is fine, <strong>I wasn\u2019t expecting my blog to become the next The New Yorker <\/strong>or to compete for the attention of people, but I very quickly realized that it was going to become truly, <strong>incredibly difficult to reach people.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To add to the pressure point, I feel like most people who are even reading blogs are looking for solutions to problems,<em> they want to quickly get an answer.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In consequence, more thought-based articles like this one <strong>fall into oblivion a lot of the times, <\/strong>which I think is rather interesting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I previously said, to me this isn\u2019t a problem,<strong> I write because I wanted a place where I could improve my writing skills and share some thoughts. <\/strong>I was not expecting a huge audience, and you shouldn\u2019t as well!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Write for the sake of writing, because it is a fun thing to do, not because it will be a foolish obligatory thing adding up to the 50 other foolish obligatory things you\u2019re doing.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are the only one who cares, accept and keep writing when you feel like it. I said I would write about 1-3 articles per week, I\u2019ve managed to consistently write 2 articles every week, last week I was not feeling it and I simply didn\u2019t write a second article. <strong>You must not feel obligated to do something that should be fun to do, I was not in the mood I simply did not wrote an article \u2013 period.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2 \u2013 Get to the point<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>People want solutions to problems they don\u2019t have, <\/strong>they don\u2019t have time, they don\u2019t care about the person writing. Creating a piece of content that people will at least read means <strong>you have to get to the point. Even if it means writing shorter articles.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">People usually like a well-paced story over a boring 2000-page eternal journey that never ends. So, give them that.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>But also write <strong>fun stuff, stuff that you would want to read and share with others. <\/strong>Keep it smart and simple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting to the point is hard but don\u2019t forget design school \u2013 <strong>less is more.<\/strong> Don\u2019t go around 1000 words to say you really hate oranges,<strong> just say you hate oranges<\/strong> and explain why you hate oranges after that. People will be much more invested.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3 \u2013 Pose questions and solve problems<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To me most articles I write either come from a question that I have, a problem that I wish was solved, or just an urge to write about something.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Out of all the posts I wrote the past month <strong>the ones I wrote that posed questions and offered solutions were the ones to get the most amount of engagement.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the next time you write an article for your blog think about this, <strong>what problem do you have a solution for? What question do you have that others may also have?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Humans are inherently curious beings, so like the little kid you once were,<strong> ask questions, lots of them.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4 \u2013 Be human<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In an age where <strong>most content you now see online is basically generated by AI,<\/strong> being human will in my view be very important in the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Showing my human side is something that I never imagined I would struggle with, <\/strong>but I have come up with my own conclusions about that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Write in the first person, address the audience, be direct, share experiences, and don\u2019t be afraid of being silly.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout my articles, I really tried to employ these tactics in order for <strong>my blog to be or feel more human <\/strong>to whoever reads it. By talking about my dad on a post, my struggles as a student, or just simply by sharing a Spider-Man meme, <strong>suddenly what was once a robotic post now feels more human,<\/strong> more relatable, more me, more you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5 \u2013 What do you want to read?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Although writing for the sake of writing is a good thing, no judging. <strong>Writing about something that you are interested in inherently allows you to understand people in your target audience.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next time you write an article don\u2019t just think about what you want to write,<strong> think about what you would also like to read.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing, like many things, is a constant exercise that takes time, takes practice and allows for development. <strong>My first articles probably weren\u2019t that good,<\/strong> but they served a purpose \u2013 to allow me to grow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you take this into consideration, <strong>you will feel much more comfortable,<\/strong> writing will not be so much about an audience, but it will be more like this thing we do for us that others can be a part of. \u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you write what you want to read it will also provide you with more ideas, make you more invested and consequently <strong>make you create better articles.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the next time you write, <strong>think about those who read!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">On a final note, I would love for you to share your blog on the comment section below<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of the design community, I see this space as a place of sharing, so if you are also starting a blog or have your blog <strong>share it below,<\/strong> it could be a blog about anything, I\u2019m interested to read what you write about in your free time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for reading, as per usual, you can read the previous article <a href=\"https:\/\/design-hugo.com\/mx-keys-s-combo-review-is-it-worth-the-hype\/\"><strong>here<\/strong>.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>See ya later alligator!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>After about a month in the blogging scene I\u2019ve learned a few important things that leveled up my content, today I want to share with you these 5 things that you and all bloggers need to know!
