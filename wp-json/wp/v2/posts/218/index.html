The new possibilities in terms of technology have been increasing the types of supports we can use motion in, to me motion will be a part of every designer\u2019s skillset in a few years.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In many ways,<strong> when we look at the world that surrounds us,<\/strong> more and more, <strong>we see static formats slowly disappearing. <\/strong>An example of this in Portugal recently has been the introduction of digital Mupis on bus stops.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What was once a place for a <strong>completely static poster<\/strong> is now basically a <strong>digital playground for motion design.<\/strong> This is just an example, but many more places are suffering these types of changes, from the introduction of the e-book to televisions replacing static posters in movie theaters, e<strong>verything is changing to become less static.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I challenge you to take a look around you<\/strong> and identify these small details in our day-to-day activities, you will most likely see different examples than the one I previously mentioned, <strong>you just need to keep your eyes wide open.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The evolution of software and hardware<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the Mupis I was talking about technology in general has improved dramatically over the years. <strong>We are lucky to be a part of one of the most interesting generations ever.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">If you took a look at the world 25 years ago it was a vastly different place in terms of technology, forget your high res Tv, your laptop, your smartphone, your high-speed internet connection and bring back the CRTs, the Nokia phones, the dial-up internet and all the other marvels of late 90s technology.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>My point is \u2013 <strong>there has been a dramatic change in technology in a very short time frame.<\/strong> Although nowadays its starting to slow down a bit <strong>the evolution of technology is as obvious as my name being Hugo.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the last few years, a lot of these technological revolutions have turned out to be related to <strong>finding new ways of implementing screens into your life.<\/strong> Making them <strong>cheaper and easier to make<\/strong> has only translated into the <strong>propagation of screens to almost everything we use<\/strong> that involves some type of technology.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the future Motion Design will be important as we move to an <strong>era of new supports<\/strong> like augmented and virtual reality, but also as we move to an era of <strong>full\/increasing replacement of static media.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The world of advertising and media is already changing by the clock so we must evolve and adapt with the times. <\/strong>Accepting that motion is going to be a big part of your life is the first step.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The new age of social media<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember good old <strong>MSN,<\/strong> no? What about <strong>Hi5?<\/strong> Hey, do you even remember<strong> Facebook?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s very strange how social media platforms have been changing over the years, but one thing that isn\u2019t strange to me is <strong>how every single one of them started to get some type of way of showing you videos<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Instagram, X (rip Twitter), Facebook, TikTok, and others have one thing in common besides basically copying each other \u2013 the possibility of sharing videos.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This fact <strong>single-handedly makes Motion Design even more important.<\/strong> If you want to stand out you can\u2019t be static.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we move into the future, platforms focused on video sharing seem to be slowly taking over,<strong> Motion Design in my eyes will play an essential role in the future of social media.<\/strong> Every brand, every product, everything really <strong>will seek to have motion attached to it.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Animation has never been more accessible<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On one side we have an <strong>ever-expanding industry<\/strong> only increasing in the future, on the other, <strong>we have software that has become easier to use.<\/strong> We don\u2019t need the mess that was Flash animation, nowadays we have <strong>After-effects,<\/strong> several 3d and 2d animation software, and of course the incredible <a href=\"http:\/\/blender.org\"><strong>Blender.<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to <strong>YouTube, platforms like Skillshare, and School of Motion<\/strong> learning Motion Design has never been <strong>cheaper and more accessible.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">I have to say I really do like Blender, the community is incredible, and personally speaking, I see it taking over the industry standard Cinema 4D in the near future.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact that a piece of software is so loved and remains free shows the type of people behind <strong>Blender <\/strong>and why it is<strong> the tool to learn <\/strong>if you are looking to learn 3D and animation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https:\/\/design-hugo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/untitled-1024x576.png\" alt=\"3d image of a credit card mockup\" class=\"wp-image-219\" style=\"width:750px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/design-hugo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/untitled-1024x576.png 1024w, https:\/\/design-hugo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/untitled-300x169.png 300w, https:\/\/design-hugo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/untitled-768x432.png 768w, https:\/\/design-hugo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/untitled-1536x864.png 1536w, https:\/\/design-hugo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/untitled.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Cool Credit Card Mockup I made in Blender (I still have to figure out the whole animation thing)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why is motion design a key skill that every designer needs to learn in 2024?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Last but not least on my to-talk list is the answer to the starting question of this article. <strong>It\u2019s a key skill every designer should learn because motion design has never been easier and more important in our industry.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently award-winning agencies such as <a href=\"http:\/\/studiodumbar.com\"><strong>Studio Dumbar<\/strong><\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/wolffolins.com\"><strong>Wolff Olins<\/strong><\/a> have been releasing successful project after successful project. The <strong>one key ingredient <\/strong>almost every project they share has in common is <strong>motion.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">If you look at these agencies motion stands almost as a core component in every single project and its no coincidence that they have become two of the most popular agencies in the world.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I suggest you <em>look <\/em><strong>around you, accept motion and work on your skillset, <\/strong>because believe me this will become the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">On a final note, here are a few suggestions if you want to get started with motion design<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@DerekElliott\"><strong>Derek Elliot<\/strong><\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.schoolofmotion.com\/\"><strong>School of Motion<\/strong><\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@blenderguru\"><strong>Blender Guru<\/strong><\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@BenMarriott\"><strong>Ben Marriott<\/strong><\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@SonduckFilm\"><strong>SounduckFilm<\/strong><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Although on the shorter side, <strong>I do hope this article has at least made you interested in motion, <\/strong>don\u2019t forget to leave a comment below I\u2019m interested to read your opinions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think different.
