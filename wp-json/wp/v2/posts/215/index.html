Lately, my head has been contemplating <strong>the future of our field,<\/strong> particularly after I listened to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.creativeboom.com\/podcast\/stefan-sagmeister\/\"><strong>99<sup>th<\/sup> episode of the Creative Boom Podcast with Stefan Sagmeister.<\/strong><\/a> (Highly recommend it)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article <strong>I\u2019m not answering to \u201cWhat does the future of design look like?\u201d<\/strong> but instead to start a conversation. So, if you feel like it <strong>leave a comment below!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The current state of design<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Design today has suffered many changes, <strong>we live in a mostly digital age,<\/strong> and as such <strong>the supports we play with are vastly different.<\/strong> To me, it&#8217;s interesting to look around and see <strong>different technologies coexist,<\/strong> you can read a newspaper physically or do it on your phone, and the same for books and many other types of mediums, even other types of products have changed \u2013 for example Car UI, <strong>you can drive a 90s car without barely any type of UI or drive the latest generation of cars with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.edenspiekermann.com\/whitepaper\/how-to-design-in-car-ux-that-doesnt-suck\/\">incredibly designed car UI.<\/a><\/strong> This coexistence is very interesting to me, and I think when I look at the current state of design it&#8217;s interesting the vast types of mediums we have at our disposal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Design today has fundamentally changed, when we look at history,<strong> we see how it has evolved from a discipline that no one knew to one of the biggest fields of study<\/strong> <strong>in the world.<\/strong> Obviously, this also translated into an <strong>increase in competition.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, a <strong>side-effect <\/strong>related to the evolution of technology is how it has become <strong>more accessible. <\/strong>Thanks to the dawn of the internet era and the development of software, <strong>what was once a specialized area filled with few but incredibly talented people has now become an increasingly competitive field with a lot of untalented unknowledgeable people producing lackluster work.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Imagine if suddenly a bunch of courses and tools were invented and introduced to make a doctor\u2019s job easier but as a consequence, everyone thought that just by learning how to clean a wound they instantly could become a doctor. That\u2019s how the landscape of design is today.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Although a bit exaggerated, I\u2019ve created this comparison as a <strong>way to explain to you my view<\/strong> on a lot of design projects and people. <strong>I don\u2019t have anything against it, but it creates a lot of problems, <\/strong>particularly the devaluation of a designer\u2019s job.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most recent innovation that was talked about by everyone and created a lot of buzz in several industries without a doubt has been AI, <strong>probably the biggest creation in the last 10 years.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In design AI created kind of a panic, we saw a lot of the people previously mentioned feel threatened and a lot of businesses replacing design and marketing teams at a very fast rate. But one has to ask, <strong>is this a bad thing?<\/strong> I will talk about this a bit later but to me, it isn\u2019t such a big problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Looking into the past to project the future<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I think its <strong>very smart to look into the past to project the future,<\/strong> this is even more valid when we talk about technology.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember about the<strong> buzz <\/strong>when <strong>personal computers<\/strong> were first introduced? <strong>It completely changed the design landscape,<\/strong> what once took <strong>hours to do through tedious analog processes,<\/strong> was now <strong>possible to do with a few clicks,<\/strong> without you having to get your hands dirty. <strong>Isn\u2019t this the same with AI?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI like personal computers <strong>scared a lot of people<\/strong> but in my view in the near future<strong> it will become a nearly invaluable piece of technology<\/strong> for many people\u2019s lives. Even software manufacturers have already adapted to the times starting to offer a lot of AI based tools, like for example <strong>Photoshop\u2019s generative AI tool.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Like the personal computer or the internet, a lot of people freaked out with AI but eventually, those who accept these tools grow to outdo their colleagues who don\u2019t. <\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I\u2019m not saying that you should use AI but be smart and look into it, so like many designers in the past who didn\u2019t you don\u2019t fall into oblivion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Will AI replace designers?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout this article, I\u2019ve pretty much given my opinion on AI and how it\u2019s affecting the world but the top question is <strong>if it\u2019s going to replace us?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my humble opinion it will replace a lot of work that you didn\u2019t want to be involved in, <strong>a lot of clients who want cheap solutions<\/strong> that know nothing about design probably will use AI.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The clients who realize design is a<strong> human based field that creates products for human based clients <\/strong>will dismiss AI. This is already happening but I do believe it will only increase in the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Inherently this means, less bad-quality clients, more people interested in your services, more competition, and probably more money.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>So those who are good will <strong>undoubtedly stand out <\/strong>against a plethora of average unhuman work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the future<strong> AI will only replace bad clients,<\/strong> <strong>not good quality designers<\/strong> who take clients through an extensive process that culminates in the final result. At the end of the day,<strong> design is very human and the end product is for humans so replacement by AI isn\u2019t an option<\/strong> for those who are serious about their business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Is design a good career for the future?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Honestly, I feel <strong>praise for good designers will only increase <\/strong>as we move to an age of <strong>pure digital trash.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more you look into developing your <strong>design skills and soft-skills<\/strong> the better. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Soft-skills in particular will be increasingly more important. The more you understand your client, and the more you build a human-level relationship the better, particularly for the end product.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I also expect <strong>designer salaries and project budgets <\/strong>will in general increase, <strong>alongside with the competition<\/strong> for a job position. This will be a direct consequence of lower-budget clients moving to AI-based tools.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my view, <strong>design will be a good career for the future<\/strong> as we continue to move to an even more digitalized industry. <strong>But,<\/strong> beware of the few points I talked about,<strong> the increase in competition and lackluster work will be very real, and you will have to seek inspiration in unusual places and possibly fight harder for an average job.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are the biggest problems facing designers in the future?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The world we are heading towards seems a much better place in many areas, <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/sagmeister.com\/work\/now-is-better-book\/\">Stefan Sagmeister\u2019s new book put this into perspective for me,<\/a> <\/strong>and I\u2019m excited about the possibilities that we will have when AI and other technologies such as <strong>virtual and augmented reality<\/strong> play a bigger role in our lives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">I feel like designers will have a very important role in the successful communication of world issues that become either worse or less mentioned in media.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A long time from now I believe<strong> traditional media will completely change<\/strong> alongside<strong> traditional advertising<\/strong> making designers rethink new ways to communicate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Motion will become an even bigger part of our day-to-day, infiltrating itself into all the design fields.<\/strong> Static content will either disappear or become a very point of focus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Social media will reach a <strong>blow-up point <\/strong>and this is when a new formula will appear, as such <strong>we will have to readapt.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Typeface design and major typefaces will have to adapt<\/strong> as we move to an age of further developed augmented and virtual reality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are eventually going to reach a point in which the <strong>current brutalist and maximalist trends will disappear in favor of a much more depurated approach<\/strong> from the days of designers such as <strong>Massimo Vignelli.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What does the future look like for graphic designers?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To me the future looks bright,<strong> I do believe traditional graphic design will change,<\/strong> perhaps our work category will change definitely to <strong>communication designer<\/strong> or<strong> visual designer, <\/strong>we already see a lot of these terms being used frequently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Subsequently, education in design will change, and a <strong>focus on motion, product, and digital design <\/strong>seems to be an obvious update to the standard curriculum. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Perhaps the introduction of terms such as innovation in design or human-to-human design will become classes.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>With the constant development of technology, <strong>we face exciting new challenges every day,<\/strong> it will be our role like those who came before<strong> to adapt to a new age.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m excited to see the future of design and although it will, to me, be more competitive it will also create <strong>interesting new opportunities<\/strong> to communicate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">On a final note, this article is very speculative but it was written to kickstart an important conversation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As people involved in this industry, we need to be able to start and maintain conversations about the future. <strong>Get involved.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are interested in reading more, please check out <a href=\"https:\/\/design-hugo.com\/5-must-read-books-for-designers\/\"><strong>my last article.<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please write a thoughtful comment below, I will try to answer all of them!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stay safe.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What does the future of design look like?
