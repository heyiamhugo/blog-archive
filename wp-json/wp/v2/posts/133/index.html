I absolutely love it and I think you and I can learn a lot from it. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Red, yellow and purple are three colors that don\u2019t make much sense but when put together they just work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main takeaway is to<strong> experiment with color and overall composition of elements,<\/strong> sometimes we tend to get stuck with grids or formulas that we have learned, and we could experiment and get amazing results. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Formulas are good but sometimes we need to explore beyond them.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Code Orange \u2013 The above<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"599\" height=\"546\" src=\"https:\/\/design-hugo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/R-28429588-1697995453-7695.jpg\" alt=\"The Above by Code Orange Album Cover\" class=\"wp-image-138\" style=\"aspect-ratio:1.0970695970695972;width:750px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/design-hugo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/R-28429588-1697995453-7695.jpg 599w, https:\/\/design-hugo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/R-28429588-1697995453-7695-300x273.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Album Cover image from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.discogs.com\/\">Discogs<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, let me say I love <strong>Code Orange,<\/strong> if you haven\u2019t listened to their stuff check it out. I was a huge fan of their older album cover designs. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bold colors, bold typography it just worked.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think The Above was a nice <strong>improvement<\/strong> on their formula for album cover design and the overall vinyl set looks awesome.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really think<strong> composition<\/strong> is a big takeaway from this cover, the focus on the image and the overall graphic treatment is also a very interesting point.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I takeaway from this is that we sometimes avoid using simple compositions, but <strong>this album turns a very simple composition which is very effective and levels it up with the graphic treatmen<\/strong>t. So don\u2019t be afraid of using effective more simple compositions, embrace white space and experiment with effects\/digital treatment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Black Keys &#8211; Brothers<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" src=\"https:\/\/design-hugo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/R-2284952-1626530490-7581.jpg\" alt=\"Brothers by The Black Keys Album Cover\" class=\"wp-image-139\" style=\"aspect-ratio:1;width:750px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/design-hugo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/R-2284952-1626530490-7581.jpg 600w, https:\/\/design-hugo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/R-2284952-1626530490-7581-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/design-hugo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/R-2284952-1626530490-7581-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Album Cover image from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.discogs.com\/\">Discogs<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brothers is the sixth studio album of <strong>The Black Keys <\/strong>released on May 18, 2010. This album cover became an instant classic, red, black, white and Cooper Black \u2013 <strong>what more could we ask for!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really do think it\u2019s perhaps one of the<strong> most iconic albums covers of the 2010s,<\/strong> alongside AM by <strong>Artic <\/strong>Monkeys. Albums that just embraced simplicity and showed that sometimes less is more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you must take any album here and use it as an example of what an iconic album cover can look like I would recommend Brothers. Again, the same points I previously mentioned apply here, composition, color, typography, embracing white space. <strong>Do I need to say more?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Red Hot Chili Peppers \u2013 By the way<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" src=\"https:\/\/design-hugo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/R-1162737-1197254678.jpg\" alt=\"By the Way by The Red Hot Chili Peppers Album Cover\" class=\"wp-image-140\" style=\"aspect-ratio:1;width:750px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/design-hugo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/R-1162737-1197254678.jpg 600w, https:\/\/design-hugo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/R-1162737-1197254678-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/design-hugo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/R-1162737-1197254678-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Album Cover image from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.discogs.com\/\">Discogs<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arguably my favorite band, I just had to mention them. Their eighth studio album <strong>By the Way <\/strong>was released July 9, 2002.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I talked about breaking formulas before and experimentation, but I really do think the By the Way album cover is probably one of the best examples of this. <strong>It\u2019s incredibly expressive and features a very interesting typography treatment too.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If had to take any lesson from it, it would be the same that I took from Discovery, <strong>to experiment with materials, get away from the computer and try stuff out.<\/strong> I don\u2019t really like to paint or draw but sometimes we need to get uncomfortable to create unique stuff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">On a final note, the main takeaways here are to experiment with design elements, get uncomfortable, less is more, formulas are good and sometimes breaking them is also good.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is about it, I know this wasn\u2019t very extensive, this was as I said in the beginning to just make the point that you should look at things differently and take lessons from them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope you found this article useful, please if you have any suggestions leave a comment below, I will try to read and answer them all!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, you can read the previous <a href=\"https:\/\/design-hugo.com\/5-things-every-design-student-needs-to-hear\/\"><strong>article here!<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for reading, I hope you enjoyed!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Music is great, no doubt about that, and in this article, I want to explore some of my favorite album covers and what I learned from them as a designer.
