Also, a quick disclaimer: I do not support or endorse piracy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/adobe.com\"><strong>Adobe<\/strong><\/a> sure has come a long way from its <strong>one time payment<\/strong> per version model to its current Creative Cloud <strong>subscription<\/strong> model. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This change in one way has contributed to the <strong>crackdown on people who pirated their software <\/strong>&#8211; it introduced more affordable monthly tiers but users completely lost the previous buying system, which from <a href=\"http:\/\/adobe.com\"><strong>Adobe\u2019s<\/strong><\/a> side makes sense when we look at it from a business perspective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I know about <strong>perpetual licenses<\/strong> but they aren\u2019t exactly a replacement, they are targeted toward organizations and offer <strong>just a 1-3-year<\/strong> plan instead of a <strong>lifetime payment for a version.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why are Adobe Cloud pricing models increasing piracy and why Adobe is not doing anything about it<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s take a look at the current <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.adobe.com\/pt\/creativecloud\/plans.html?promoid=NV3KR7S1&amp;mv=other\">Adobe Cloud pricing system<\/a> <\/strong>for individual users:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All apps &#8211; <strong>36.89 \u20ac<\/strong> first year\/ <strong>64.03 \u20ac<\/strong> on renovation<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Individual programs (All except Acrobat, Express, Firefly, Lightroom, Substance 3D Collection, Substance 3D Texturing, Stock, and InCopy) &#8211; <strong>24,59 \u20ac<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Photography plan (Photoshop + Lightroom) &#8211; <strong>9,83 \u20ac<\/strong> first year\/ <strong>12,29 \u20ac<\/strong> on renovation<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please take into consideration that these <strong>values<\/strong> were taken from <strong>Adobe Portugal<\/strong> at the time of writing this post as a <strong>reference for conversation<\/strong>. I also think it\u2019s great if you take a quick look at what plans Adobe offers for <strong>companies, schools, students, and ONGs.<\/strong> From these, I think it\u2019s worth it to also consider the <strong>student plan<\/strong> for the conversation which is <strong>19,99 \u20ac <\/strong>first year\/ <strong>36,89 \u20ac<\/strong> on renovation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are the issues with the current pricing system?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>When we take a look at these values, they don\u2019t seem actually that bad right? Well, if you are an <strong>American or live in a stable country<\/strong> in terms of the economy like Germany probably these are fully <strong>justified<\/strong> prices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you like me live in <strong>Portugal<\/strong> which is still a <strong>developed country but with a terrible economy <\/strong>or if you live in a <strong>developing country<\/strong> these values are <strong>not justified!<\/strong> Personally, I currently <strong>do not own<\/strong> an Adobe Cloud subscription because I have the software available from the company I\u2019m interning at. Even for small businesses, the prices for the Adobe Cloud subscription are <strong>unsustainable.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as a former university student I know a lot of teachers in Portugal who simply tell their students to just <strong>\u201cfind it online\u201d<\/strong> because universities here <strong>neither want to nor are expected <\/strong>to have the money to spend on Adobe Cloud for their students \u2013 <strong>it gets very expensive.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So as a student here in Portugal and in many other countries, who is enrolled at a university that doesn\u2019t supply Creative Cloud, <strong>you either find a job or resort to piracy.<\/strong> As someone who had <strong>two jobs<\/strong>, paying a very high tuition I guarantee you that if I hadn\u2019t been offered an <a href=\"http:\/\/adobe.com\"><strong>Adobe<\/strong><\/a> subscription I would probably have resorted to these<strong> same methods.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Adobe\u2019s efforts to combat piracy<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The Creative Cloud itself was a way to combat piracy, having a cloud-based system for your apps majorly affects the difficulty associated with the technical part of pirating. Adobe itself, if you have a read on their website, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adobe.com\/trust\/fraud-prevention.html\"><strong>\u201cidentify evolving fraud trends, stop known exploits, close gaps, reduce financial impacts, and work hard to keep customers safe in our systems. And we help you verify that your Adobe subscriptions and software are legitimate\u201d.<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This combination of these factors <strong>protects their software and protects you<\/strong> but the major problem is still there \u2013 <strong>Creative Cloud isn\u2019t cheap.<\/strong> If it <strong>isn\u2019t affordable<\/strong> to the majority of the population people will resort to <strong>\u201cfind it online\u201d<\/strong>, and then we return to the same problem how <a href=\"http:\/\/adobe.com\"><strong>Adobe<\/strong><\/a> could stop piracy right now and why they are not doing it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why is piracy bad for Adobe and for you<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Although it isn\u2019t as easy as it used to be there are still one or two reputable pirates out there putting out <strong>every single version, every single year.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To put it in very simple terms <strong>piracy can degrade a brand very easily,<\/strong> versions of your software being spit out with <strong>malware <\/strong>and other types of viruses eventually affect your company. <strong>Protecting your developers and your product should be a priority.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s <strong>illegal<\/strong> of course but there is also a <strong>loss of revenue<\/strong> which inherently affects <strong>innovation<\/strong> and <strong>support,<\/strong> <strong>security risks<\/strong> are also a problem with <strong>piracy<\/strong> &#8211; data breaches, identity theft, and other cybercrimes are just a <strong>few steps away from your well rounded hacker.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But probably the worst part is that <strong>it hurts the industry:<\/strong> Widespread piracy can harm the software industry as a whole, as I\u2019ve mentioned <strong>discouraging innovation<\/strong> and negatively impacting software developers and their <strong>livelihoods.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Personally, this to me is a problem that could be easily solved with a few changes to Adobe\u2019s pricing strategy but more on that later.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Piracy is bad for companies and for users but a lot of companies use this as tactical marketing.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me be the <strong>devil\u2019s advocate<\/strong> here, put my <strong>tinfoil hat<\/strong> and comment a little bit on this. The main reason I think <a href=\"http:\/\/adobe.com\"><strong>Adobe<\/strong><\/a> recognizes piracy and <strong>they claim<\/strong> they are doing something to stop it but they are still not doing it is because <strong>it generates clients.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People who <strong>don\u2019t have the means now<\/strong> to pay for your subscription <strong>are going to have them later<\/strong> and become clients, this is also one of things I think <a href=\"http:\/\/adobe.com\"><strong>Adobe<\/strong><\/a> takes into consideration when making their prices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">If you look at Adobe\u2019s history they grew a lot because of piracy, it\u2019s basically free marketing for them and a better trial format. Who doesn\u2019t remember those old videos of a random person writing on a notepad on YouTube teaching how to download and install Adobe \u2013 I guarantee a lot of those people who used to watch these videos are Adobe\u2019s client base today.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing this article and doing some research I came a cross a thread on <a href=\"http:\/\/quora.com\"><strong>Quora<\/strong><\/a> and a comment by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.quora.com\/How-is-Adobe-detecting-pirated-versions-of-its-software-on-peoples-computers\"><strong>Jahil Nelson<\/strong><\/a> that <strong>perfectly resumes this.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe only thing <strong>worse<\/strong> than a bunch of people pirating your software is \u2026<strong> nobody pirating your software.<\/strong> It\u2019s no coincidence that the <strong>highest<\/strong> pirated software is Microsoft Windows and Word, while Microsoft is also the one of the richest companies in the world. <strong>It sounds like a paradox but the more people who know your software ecosystem, by paid means or otherwise, the more successful your platform is likely to be.\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c\u2026Those people are all <strong>potential future customers <\/strong>and if or when they cross over to successful artists, they should pay for software. But along the way, it\u2019s actually in Adobes interest that there is a <strong>path for them to crack their software.<\/strong> It shouldn\u2019t be too easy, but easy enough for anyone who is willing to make that extra effort. <strong>I know this because I was once a 17-year-old kid with a dream and no money.<\/strong> And if Adobe wasn\u2019t hackable and I had to use something else instead, <strong>I would have never had a reason to learn their software and eventually join that ecosystem<\/strong> which I now pay into and influence the companies I have worked for to do as well.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How can Adobe stop piracy for good<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I think they key to this is <strong>changing the pricing system, make it more affordable!<\/strong> Even better make it <strong>100% free<\/strong> for all students. But instead of just complaining let me make a proper suggestion to <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/adobe.com\">Adobe<\/a>:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reintroduce the option for clients to buy specific versions as one time payments \u2013 <strong>299.99 \u20ac<\/strong> for individual programs, <strong>799.99 \u20ac<\/strong> for all the programs in the Creative Cloud for that version.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All apps &#8211; <strong>39.99 \u20ac<\/strong> first year\/ <strong>59.99 \u20ac<\/strong> on renovation<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All Individual programs &#8211; <strong>19,99 \u20ac<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Photography plan (Photoshop + Lightroom) &#8211; <strong>9,99 \u20ac<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Introduce New Plans alongside the Photography Plan: Designer Plan (Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator) and Videography Plan (Premiere, After Effects, Media Encoder) \u2013 <strong>12.99 \u20ac<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Free<\/strong> for all students or at a <strong>50%<\/strong> discount<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Free<\/strong> for all ONG\u2019S or at a <strong>50%<\/strong> discount<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think <a href=\"http:\/\/adobe.com\"><strong>Adobe<\/strong><\/a> should provide the chance for people to <strong>contact them and expose their situation<\/strong> in order to get individualized plans (people from developing countries, special cases, etc).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">On a final note, this article wasn\u2019t made to try to offend Adobe, I just gave honest feedback about what could be done and I hope they listen to it<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have any opinions on this topic <strong>please leave a comment,<\/strong> this type of article is made in order to <strong>start a conversation,<\/strong> not to be a monologue!
