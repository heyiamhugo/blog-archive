In the book Vignelli teaches us about his philosophy on design and <strong>shares with us<\/strong> his iconic list of the only <strong>6 typefaces you need,<\/strong> claiming that <strong>you can trash the rest.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rediscovering this made me think <strong>\u201cHmm would his list today be the same?\u201d<\/strong> with the evolution of technology and design trends I imagine his list would also evolve with the times. The matter of the fact is <strong>it\u2019s still a relevant list that all designers still talk about today!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The way you should see this article is very simple \u2013 <strong>it\u2019s my own view <\/strong>of what those 6 typefaces would be,<strong> not an updated Vignelli list,<\/strong> just my list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u201cIn the new computer age the proliferation of typefaces and type manipulations represents a new level of visual pollution threating our culture. Out of thousands of typefaces, all we need are a few basic ones, and trash the rest. So come and see A Few Basic Typefaces\u201d <em>\u2013 Massimo Vignelli<\/em><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In a nutshell here is Vignelli\u2019s list:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Garamond<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Bodoni<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Century Expanded<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Futura<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Times Roman<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Helvetica<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This list in my view <strong>is still very viable<\/strong> but I don\u2019t think a lot of these typefaces<strong> stand the test of time <\/strong>as good as they probably should, <strong>either they have been redesigned or there are just better options.<\/strong> <strong>Don\u2019t take this opinion from just me,<\/strong> see what people like <strong>Erik Spiekermann<\/strong> think of <strong>Helvetica,<\/strong> probably the most iconic typeface ever made \u2013 <a href=\"https:\/\/spiekermann.com\/en\/helvetica-sucks\/\"><strong>\u201cHelvetica sucks.

The typeface&#8217;s historical connection gives it a touch of <strong>timeless sophistication,<\/strong> making it a suitable choice for a range of design applications.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of Bodoni Moda&#8217;s key strengths is its <strong>high contrast between thick and thin strokes,<\/strong> which is a hallmark of the Bodoni style. This contrast gives the typeface a <strong>distinct and striking appearance<\/strong> that works exceptionally well for headlines, titles, and other display text. <strong>The sharp, geometric letterforms contribute to a sense of refinement and modernity.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bodoni Moda is available in various weights and styles, making it versatile for different design projects.

This makes Fira Sans an excellent choice for content across various mediums.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fira Sans offers an extensive range of weights and styles, including regular, italic, bold, and condensed versions.

Designed by one of my favorite designers it\u2019s a <strong>humanistic sans-serif typeface that fits the list really well, <\/strong>it\u2019s one of the key elements I believe <strong>Vignelli\u2019s list lacks.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Switzer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/design-hugo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/switzer.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-195\" srcset=\"https:\/\/design-hugo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/switzer.png 1000w, https:\/\/design-hugo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/switzer-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/design-hugo.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/switzer-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Inspired by<strong> neo-grotesk Swiss typefaces <\/strong>Switzer is a typeface designed by Indian Type Foundry. This modern interpretation translated to a modern geometric sans-serif that is very legible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like Fira Sans and Poppins, the key strength is its <strong>exceptional legibility and simplicity. <\/strong>The letterforms although geometric have a lot of character. <strong>Balanced, clean, and very straightforward <\/strong>Switzer is an <strong>essential typeface.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why is this typeface on my list?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In my opinion, this typeface solves the main issues I and many designers have with Helvetica, <strong>it has character but it still shares the key qualities of Helvetica.<\/strong> It\u2019s a workhorse of a typeface completely free which is also incredible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">So, this was my list, with these 6 typefaces I believe most designers will have their needs covered. Compared to Vignelli\u2019s list it actually is fairly similar although I\u2019ve replaced one of the serifs for a humanistic sans-serif typeface which in my opinion, and for my work, was the missing ingredient!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What makes this list good?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Versatility<\/strong> was the key aspect when I was making this list, I wanted three serifs and three sans-serifs that <strong>were versatile but that at the same time covered the several aspects that make each category unique. <\/strong>When looking to<strong> Vignelli\u2019s <\/strong>list and mine you can clearly see what I mean, both lists follow the same thought process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to also include the most amount of <strong>variable and web-ready typefaces <\/strong>as I believe this type of technology is the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why have I chosen only free typefaces?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mainly because they are<strong> widely available and easier to integrate, <\/strong>but also because <strong>I don\u2019t like the fact that I have to pay thousands for Helvetica when better, free typefaces are available. <\/strong>I don\u2019t like the types of prices most foundries ask for a single individual font, as a student it bothered me.<strong> I\u2019m really glad we live in a time and age where free typefaces are a lot of the times good or better than paid ones.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the future, I hope projects like <strong>Google Fonts <\/strong>or <strong>Adobe Fonts <\/strong>continue to make proper efforts to support type designers and provide great typefaces for free. I will also always support foundries that make great typefaces open-source, free, or adequately priced. <strong>You\u2019re awesome!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">On a final note, let me remind you that mine or Vignelli\u2019s list are just a basis, you can and should always expand on it and search for better alternatives.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you look at Vignelli\u2019s work you will see other typefaces, for example, the Ducati logo he designed uses Univers. So<strong> be open to new horizons and support type designers and small foundries<\/strong> whenever you can!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for reading, as per usual I would love to read your opinion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can read the last article <a href=\"https:\/\/design-hugo.com\/5-must-have-items-every-designer-needs-in-their-toolkit\/\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the current day and age of design we have thousands and thousands of typefaces to choose from, so in this article following the lessons of modernist designers like Massimo Vignelli, I\u2019m going to tell you the only 6 typefaces you need and that are the basis of my collection.
