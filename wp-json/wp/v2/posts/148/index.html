Pretty much nothing.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look, this article isn\u2019t just to talk about them in a negative light, <strong>I do like Pantone, I do like their color system, and I do like the fact they have standardized color. <\/strong>It\u2019s useful and it makes sense.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although they can do anything they want with their product, the<strong> lack of competition<\/strong> means<strong> they can also pull stuff like Pantone Connect <\/strong>and their fight with <a href=\"http:\/\/adobe.com\"><strong>Adobe<\/strong><\/a> without having much opposition \u2013<strong> this is what actually leaves me worried.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The whole Adobe and Pantone battle and why we all lost with it<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So many articles have been written on this topic one wonders if it even makes sense to talk about it any further. <strong>Their whole battle didn\u2019t make sense at all and we all lost,<\/strong> including the companies involved in this mess.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why? Because <strong>we lost a tool that was integrated<\/strong> and extremely useful and the two major parties involved lost huge amounts of reputation and clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I understand Pantone\u2019s argument that<strong> \u201cthey have not updated the catalogs for ten years\u201d<\/strong> and their need to be paid more money by Adobe and guarantee they update their catalogs, but <strong>what I don\u2019t understand is why didn\u2019t they just implement Pantone Connect as a part of Adobe software<\/strong> going forward. Judging by the amount of money they paid for Figma I\u2019m sure Adobe could spend a few dollars making sure their software has all the tools we need.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">I\u2019ll do you one even better if you are a competitor of Adobe, besides all the features you know we need, give Pantone a call to distribute your software with Connect. I\u2019m sure Adobe would freak out a bit.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Look <strong>I love both companies I really do<\/strong>, but give me a break we all lost and I think it\u2019s very obvious how bad this whole situation is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Pantone Connect doesn\u2019t make sense<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If anyone that was involved in the process of development of Connect is reading,<strong> I\u2019m sorry but your software just doesn\u2019t work. Also, the whole business model of Connect doesn\u2019t work.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don\u2019t pay a staggering amount of money their add-on, their website, and their app are basically <strong>completely useless<\/strong> since the only feature of their software most of us need is <strong>behind a paywall.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What feature? <strong>To see color data.<\/strong> For example, let\u2019s say I have a standard formula guide coated catalog and my logo uses the color Yellow C, <strong>if I want to go to their website and see the information of what the best corresponding CMYK and RGB values would be I can\u2019t \u2013 unless I have Connect.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">I know the existence of workarounds but the point I want to make is that this completely breaks Pantone\u2019s mission of standardizing color when I have to be subscribed to just see what their recommended CMYK value for Yellow C would be.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, by the way, this also makes <strong>Formula Guide catalogs that aren\u2019t the bridge set useless, <\/strong>since you have to pay thousands for the software. It also makes Connect useless for bridge buyers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the worst of all for Pantone is <strong>it doesn\u2019t even make sense for any printer or design agency to even own Connect, <\/strong>if I\u2019m for example designing a book and I need a specific Pantone color on a page I will just make it a garish color and tell my printer that page number X is to be printed in the Pantone Color of my choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This also leads to situations in which the printer for example has Connect but the agency doesn\u2019t, so we always in one way or another go back to what I said.<strong> This didn\u2019t happen when Pantone color books were a part of Adobe software, even if outdated.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, with this whole move,<strong> Pantone has built a completely useless software,<\/strong> with an average of 1.2 stars on Play Store for their app, and the formula guides, that aren\u2019t from the bridge set, are also<strong> useless.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can Pantone solve this?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>To be honest with you I think this is a problem very difficult to solve for them.<\/strong> It would need a complete redraw of their current strategy, but if they are up to it, I believe it\u2019s a fixable problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, they should try to <strong>mend their relationship with Adobe or make Connect an integrated part of a competitor&#8217;s software,<\/strong> this would make their product essential and it would be good for Adobe\/The competitor and for them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, this means that Adobe or any other company <strong>would provide a good deal for Pantone<\/strong> and Pantone would relinquish their pricing model for their add-on. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They could even keep the subscription for the website and app, or perhaps create a premium model for the add-on and all the platforms with the free version being more generous.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">On their website, add-on and app make color data visible to everyone, the rest of the features you can hide behind a paywall.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>These changes could basically<strong> fix all their problems <\/strong>with their software ultimately leading to it being more useful and all their catalog selection being relevant again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">On a final note, I believe we all as consumers should unite a little more against these issues, after all we are their user base<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A few notes:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>I know Pantone Connect is offered for some time when you buy their Formula Guide Catalogs, but I still <strong>firmly believe <\/strong>right now their business model has affected the value proposition of both the base Formula Guide Catalogs and Connect itself.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>These types of articles are meant to <strong>kickstart a conversation,<\/strong> so please leave your comments below<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you want to buy Formula Guide Catalogs I recommend <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Pantone-FORMULA-GUIDE-COATED-UNCOATED\/dp\/B0BJ13LVD4\/ref=sr_1_4?crid=2SA8WHQT0X290&amp;keywords=pantone%252Bformula%252Bguide%252Bbridge&amp;qid=1698405823&amp;sprefix=pantone%252Bformula%252Bguide%252Bbridg%252Caps%252C148&amp;sr=8-4&amp;th=1&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=hugosnotes-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=24ae9d0643e2b2942520404d7adb4d16&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325\"><strong>these<\/strong><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You can read the article I wrote about Adobe <a href=\"https:\/\/design-hugo.com\/how-adobe-could-stop-piracy-right-now-and-why-they-are-not-doing-it\/\"><strong>here<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for reading, stay safe!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Pantone is one of the most well-known companies in the design industry, they are the industry standard for color solutions and they have built a monopoly over their slice of the market, hence why we need to talk about them.
