<p>After about a month in the blogging scene <strong>I’ve learned a few important things that leveled up my content,</strong> today I want to share with you these 5 things that you and all bloggers need to know!</p>

<p>Around a month ago I was in my bedroom thinking about writing and how I could improve my lackluster skills, suddenly an idea came to mind – <strong>what if I start a blog?</strong> I could write about anything that I felt truly passionate about and in return, I would improve my skills. <strong>Pretty good deal.</strong></p>



<p>After this first month of writing about several topics that varied from tips to my latest review of the MX Keys S Combo, I’ve been having a lot of fun. Most of my readers have been friends and random online strangers which I’m very grateful for! Seriously <strong>reading the few comments I got and seeing people interact with whatever I posted was genuinely awesome</strong> and I hope it just continues to grow onwards.</p>



<p>Although I want to be honest with you, I write not because I’m looking for approval or adoring fans but rather as a therapy for my creative mind – seriously.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Nowadays mindless content being pushed into our dopamine-filled heads is almost a day-to-day guarantee, so being able to slow down and write about whatever goes on in my mind is awesome.</h4>



<p>But anyway, if you haven’t read <a href="/my-blogging-story-why-i-started-and-how-you-can-start-right-now/"><strong>my very first article,</strong></a> I would recommend it as I go into why I started blogging and how you can also start your own thing.</p>



<p>Today’s article is in many ways <strong>a follow up, </strong>what are the lessons that I learnt from my first month blogging? Well in this article I’m going to share with you, fellow reader, 5 <strong>important things bloggers need to know.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1 – Besides you, no one cares</h2>



<p>I previously mentioned the impact of the current state of content and how blogging could be a refuge in this modern-day dopamine apocalypse,<strong> the truth is that fewer people are going to read whatever you write </strong>– consequences.</p>



<p>To me, this is fine, <strong>I wasn’t expecting my blog to become the next The New Yorker </strong>or to compete for the attention of people, but I very quickly realized that it was going to become truly, <strong>incredibly difficult to reach people.</strong></p>



<p>To add to the pressure point, I feel like most people who are even reading blogs are looking for solutions to problems,<em> they want to quickly get an answer.</em></p>



<p>In consequence, more thought-based articles like this one <strong>fall into oblivion a lot of the times, </strong>which I think is rather interesting.</p>



<p>As I previously said, to me this isn’t a problem,<strong> I write because I wanted a place where I could improve my writing skills and share some thoughts. </strong>I was not expecting a huge audience, and you shouldn’t as well!</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Write for the sake of writing, because it is a fun thing to do, not because it will be a foolish obligatory thing adding up to the 50 other foolish obligatory things you’re doing.</h4>



<p>If you are the only one who cares, accept and keep writing when you feel like it. I said I would write about 1-3 articles per week, I’ve managed to consistently write 2 articles every week, last week I was not feeling it and I simply didn’t write a second article. <strong>You must not feel obligated to do something that should be fun to do, I was not in the mood I simply did not wrote an article – period.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2 – Get to the point</h2>



<p><strong>People want solutions to problems they don’t have, </strong>they don’t have time, they don’t care about the person writing. Creating a piece of content that people will at least read means <strong>you have to get to the point. Even if it means writing shorter articles.</strong></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">People usually like a well-paced story over a boring 2000-page eternal journey that never ends. So, give them that.</h4>



<p>But also write <strong>fun stuff, stuff that you would want to read and share with others. </strong>Keep it smart and simple.</p>



<p>Getting to the point is hard but don’t forget design school – <strong>less is more.</strong> Don’t go around 1000 words to say you really hate oranges,<strong> just say you hate oranges</strong> and explain why you hate oranges after that. People will be much more invested.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3 – Pose questions and solve problems</h2>



<p>To me most articles I write either come from a question that I have, a problem that I wish was solved, or just an urge to write about something.</p>



<p>Out of all the posts I wrote the past month <strong>the ones I wrote that posed questions and offered solutions were the ones to get the most amount of engagement.</strong></p>



<p>So, the next time you write an article for your blog think about this, <strong>what problem do you have a solution for? What question do you have that others may also have?</strong></p>



<p>Humans are inherently curious beings, so like the little kid you once were,<strong> ask questions, lots of them.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4 – Be human</h2>



<p>In an age where <strong>most content you now see online is basically generated by AI,</strong> being human will in my view be very important in the future.</p>



<p><strong>Showing my human side is something that I never imagined I would struggle with, </strong>but I have come up with my own conclusions about that.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Write in the first person, address the audience, be direct, share experiences, and don’t be afraid of being silly.</h4>



<p>Throughout my articles, I really tried to employ these tactics in order for <strong>my blog to be or feel more human </strong>to whoever reads it. By talking about my dad on a post, my struggles as a student, or just simply by sharing a Spider-Man meme, <strong>suddenly what was once a robotic post now feels more human,</strong> more relatable, more me, more you.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5 – What do you want to read?</h2>



<p>Although writing for the sake of writing is a good thing, no judging. <strong>Writing about something that you are interested in inherently allows you to understand people in your target audience.</strong></p>



<p>The next time you write an article don’t just think about what you want to write,<strong> think about what you would also like to read.</strong></p>



<p>Writing, like many things, is a constant exercise that takes time, takes practice and allows for development. <strong>My first articles probably weren’t that good,</strong> but they served a purpose – to allow me to grow.</p>



<p>If you take this into consideration, <strong>you will feel much more comfortable,</strong> writing will not be so much about an audience, but it will be more like this thing we do for us that others can be a part of.  </p>



<p>If you write what you want to read it will also provide you with more ideas, make you more invested and consequently <strong>make you create better articles.</strong></p>



<p>So, the next time you write, <strong>think about those who read!</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">On a final note, I would love for you to share your blog on the comment section below</h2>



<p>As part of the design community, I see this space as a place of sharing, so if you are also starting a blog or have your blog <strong>share it below,</strong> it could be a blog about anything, I’m interested to read what you write about in your free time.</p>



<p>Thank you for reading, as per usual, you can read the previous article <a href="/mx-keys-s-combo-review-is-it-worth-the-hype/"><strong>here</strong>.</a></p>



<p>See ya later alligator!</p>

<p><a href="/what-does-the-future-of-design-look-like/"><strong>In my last article,</strong></a> I talked about my vision for the future of design and <strong>how we are very close to massive changes in the industry.</strong> Out of the several things I wrapped my head around one stood out to me the most – <strong>the future is motion.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Static is out, motion is in</h2>



<p>Over the last few years motion design undoubtedly has taken the world by storm, if we take a close look at the last 10 years, <strong>motion design has steadily, alongside UI/UX, become an increasingly important area of design.</strong></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">From TV to smartphones to ads on the street, everything nowadays is slowly becoming less static. The new possibilities in terms of technology have been increasing the types of supports we can use motion in, to me motion will be a part of every designer’s skillset in a few years.</h4>



<p>In many ways,<strong> when we look at the world that surrounds us,</strong> more and more, <strong>we see static formats slowly disappearing. </strong>An example of this in Portugal recently has been the introduction of digital Mupis on bus stops.</p>



<p>What was once a place for a <strong>completely static poster</strong> is now basically a <strong>digital playground for motion design.</strong> This is just an example, but many more places are suffering these types of changes, from the introduction of the e-book to televisions replacing static posters in movie theaters, e<strong>verything is changing to become less static.</strong></p>



<p><strong>I challenge you to take a look around you</strong> and identify these small details in our day-to-day activities, you will most likely see different examples than the one I previously mentioned, <strong>you just need to keep your eyes wide open.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The evolution of software and hardware</h2>



<p>Like the Mupis I was talking about technology in general has improved dramatically over the years. <strong>We are lucky to be a part of one of the most interesting generations ever.</strong></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">If you took a look at the world 25 years ago it was a vastly different place in terms of technology, forget your high res Tv, your laptop, your smartphone, your high-speed internet connection and bring back the CRTs, the Nokia phones, the dial-up internet and all the other marvels of late 90s technology.</h4>



<p>My point is – <strong>there has been a dramatic change in technology in a very short time frame.</strong> Although nowadays its starting to slow down a bit <strong>the evolution of technology is as obvious as my name being Hugo.</strong></p>



<p>Over the last few years, a lot of these technological revolutions have turned out to be related to <strong>finding new ways of implementing screens into your life.</strong> Making them <strong>cheaper and easier to make</strong> has only translated into the <strong>propagation of screens to almost everything we use</strong> that involves some type of technology.</p>



<p>In the future Motion Design will be important as we move to an <strong>era of new supports</strong> like augmented and virtual reality, but also as we move to an era of <strong>full/increasing replacement of static media.</strong></p>



<p><strong>The world of advertising and media is already changing by the clock so we must evolve and adapt with the times. </strong>Accepting that motion is going to be a big part of your life is the first step.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The new age of social media</h2>



<p>Remember good old <strong>MSN,</strong> no? What about <strong>Hi5?</strong> Hey, do you even remember<strong> Facebook?</strong></p>



<p>It’s very strange how social media platforms have been changing over the years, but one thing that isn’t strange to me is <strong>how every single one of them started to get some type of way of showing you videos</strong>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Instagram, X (rip Twitter), Facebook, TikTok, and others have one thing in common besides basically copying each other – the possibility of sharing videos.</h4>



<p>This fact <strong>single-handedly makes Motion Design even more important.</strong> If you want to stand out you can’t be static.</p>



<p>As we move into the future, platforms focused on video sharing seem to be slowly taking over,<strong> Motion Design in my eyes will play an essential role in the future of social media.</strong> Every brand, every product, everything really <strong>will seek to have motion attached to it.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Animation has never been more accessible</h2>



<p>On one side we have an <strong>ever-expanding industry</strong> only increasing in the future, on the other, <strong>we have software that has become easier to use.</strong> We don’t need the mess that was Flash animation, nowadays we have <strong>After-effects,</strong> several 3d and 2d animation software, and of course the incredible <a href="http://blender.org/"><strong>Blender.</strong></a></p>



<p>Thanks to <strong>YouTube, platforms like Skillshare, and School of Motion</strong> learning Motion Design has never been <strong>cheaper and more accessible.</strong></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">I have to say I really do like Blender, the community is incredible, and personally speaking, I see it taking over the industry standard Cinema 4D in the near future.</h4>



<p>The fact that a piece of software is so loved and remains free shows the type of people behind <strong>Blender </strong>and why it is<strong> the tool to learn </strong>if you are looking to learn 3D and animation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/untitled-1024x576.png" alt="3d image of a credit card mockup" class="wp-image-219" style="width:750px;height:auto" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/untitled-1024x576.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/untitled-300x169.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/untitled-768x432.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/untitled-1536x864.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/untitled.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Cool Credit Card Mockup I made in Blender (I still have to figure out the whole animation thing)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why is motion design a key skill that every designer needs to learn in 2024?</h2>



<p>Last but not least on my to-talk list is the answer to the starting question of this article. <strong>It’s a key skill every designer should learn because motion design has never been easier and more important in our industry.</strong></p>



<p>Recently award-winning agencies such as <a href="http://studiodumbar.com/"><strong>Studio Dumbar</strong></a> and <a href="http://wolffolins.com/"><strong>Wolff Olins</strong></a> have been releasing successful project after successful project. The <strong>one key ingredient </strong>almost every project they share has in common is <strong>motion.</strong></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">If you look at these agencies motion stands almost as a core component in every single project and its no coincidence that they have become two of the most popular agencies in the world.</h4>



<p>So, I suggest you <em>look </em><strong>around you, accept motion and work on your skillset, </strong>because believe me this will become the future.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">On a final note, here are a few suggestions if you want to get started with motion design</h2>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DerekElliott"><strong>Derek Elliot</strong></a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.schoolofmotion.com/"><strong>School of Motion</strong></a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@blenderguru"><strong>Blender Guru</strong></a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BenMarriott"><strong>Ben Marriott</strong></a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SonduckFilm"><strong>SounduckFilm</strong></a></li>
</ul>



<p>Although on the shorter side, <strong>I do hope this article has at least made you interested in motion, </strong>don’t forget to leave a comment below I’m interested to read your opinions.</p>



<p>Think different. Make difference.</p>

<p>Hello designers, <strong>how many of us think about the future a lot?</strong> I know I do, it&#8217;s probably a personal thing but thinking about the future is something I do quite often. Lately, my head has been contemplating <strong>the future of our field,</strong> particularly after I listened to the <a href="https://www.creativeboom.com/podcast/stefan-sagmeister/"><strong>99<sup>th</sup> episode of the Creative Boom Podcast with Stefan Sagmeister.</strong></a> (Highly recommend it)</p>



<p>In this article <strong>I’m not answering to “What does the future of design look like?”</strong> but instead to start a conversation. So, if you feel like it <strong>leave a comment below!</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The current state of design</h2>



<p>Design today has suffered many changes, <strong>we live in a mostly digital age,</strong> and as such <strong>the supports we play with are vastly different.</strong> To me, it&#8217;s interesting to look around and see <strong>different technologies coexist,</strong> you can read a newspaper physically or do it on your phone, and the same for books and many other types of mediums, even other types of products have changed – for example Car UI, <strong>you can drive a 90s car without barely any type of UI or drive the latest generation of cars with <a href="https://www.edenspiekermann.com/whitepaper/how-to-design-in-car-ux-that-doesnt-suck/">incredibly designed car UI.</a></strong> This coexistence is very interesting to me, and I think when I look at the current state of design it&#8217;s interesting the vast types of mediums we have at our disposal.</p>



<p>Design today has fundamentally changed, when we look at history,<strong> we see how it has evolved from a discipline that no one knew to one of the biggest fields of study</strong> <strong>in the world.</strong> Obviously, this also translated into an <strong>increase in competition.</strong></p>



<p>However, a <strong>side-effect </strong>related to the evolution of technology is how it has become <strong>more accessible. </strong>Thanks to the dawn of the internet era and the development of software, <strong>what was once a specialized area filled with few but incredibly talented people has now become an increasingly competitive field with a lot of untalented unknowledgeable people producing lackluster work.</strong></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Imagine if suddenly a bunch of courses and tools were invented and introduced to make a doctor’s job easier but as a consequence, everyone thought that just by learning how to clean a wound they instantly could become a doctor. That’s how the landscape of design is today.</h4>



<p>Although a bit exaggerated, I’ve created this comparison as a <strong>way to explain to you my view</strong> on a lot of design projects and people. <strong>I don’t have anything against it, but it creates a lot of problems, </strong>particularly the devaluation of a designer’s job.</p>



<p>The most recent innovation that was talked about by everyone and created a lot of buzz in several industries without a doubt has been AI, <strong>probably the biggest creation in the last 10 years.</strong></p>



<p>In design AI created kind of a panic, we saw a lot of the people previously mentioned feel threatened and a lot of businesses replacing design and marketing teams at a very fast rate. But one has to ask, <strong>is this a bad thing?</strong> I will talk about this a bit later but to me, it isn’t such a big problem.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Looking into the past to project the future</h2>



<p>I think its <strong>very smart to look into the past to project the future,</strong> this is even more valid when we talk about technology.</p>



<p>Remember about the<strong> buzz </strong>when <strong>personal computers</strong> were first introduced? <strong>It completely changed the design landscape,</strong> what once took <strong>hours to do through tedious analog processes,</strong> was now <strong>possible to do with a few clicks,</strong> without you having to get your hands dirty. <strong>Isn’t this the same with AI?</strong></p>



<p>AI like personal computers <strong>scared a lot of people</strong> but in my view in the near future<strong> it will become a nearly invaluable piece of technology</strong> for many people’s lives. Even software manufacturers have already adapted to the times starting to offer a lot of AI based tools, like for example <strong>Photoshop’s generative AI tool.</strong></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Like the personal computer or the internet, a lot of people freaked out with AI but eventually, those who accept these tools grow to outdo their colleagues who don’t. </h4>



<p>So, I’m not saying that you should use AI but be smart and look into it, so like many designers in the past who didn’t you don’t fall into oblivion.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Will AI replace designers?</h2>



<p>Throughout this article, I’ve pretty much given my opinion on AI and how it’s affecting the world but the top question is <strong>if it’s going to replace us?</strong></p>



<p>In my humble opinion it will replace a lot of work that you didn’t want to be involved in, <strong>a lot of clients who want cheap solutions</strong> that know nothing about design probably will use AI.</p>



<p>The clients who realize design is a<strong> human based field that creates products for human based clients </strong>will dismiss AI. This is already happening but I do believe it will only increase in the future.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Inherently this means, less bad-quality clients, more people interested in your services, more competition, and probably more money.</h4>



<p>So those who are good will <strong>undoubtedly stand out </strong>against a plethora of average unhuman work.</p>



<p>In the future<strong> AI will only replace bad clients,</strong> <strong>not good quality designers</strong> who take clients through an extensive process that culminates in the final result. At the end of the day,<strong> design is very human and the end product is for humans so replacement by AI isn’t an option</strong> for those who are serious about their business.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Is design a good career for the future?</h2>



<p>Honestly, I feel <strong>praise for good designers will only increase </strong>as we move to an age of <strong>pure digital trash.</strong></p>



<p>The more you look into developing your <strong>design skills and soft-skills</strong> the better. </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Soft-skills in particular will be increasingly more important. The more you understand your client, and the more you build a human-level relationship the better, particularly for the end product.</h4>



<p>I also expect <strong>designer salaries and project budgets </strong>will in general increase, <strong>alongside with the competition</strong> for a job position. This will be a direct consequence of lower-budget clients moving to AI-based tools.</p>



<p>In my view, <strong>design will be a good career for the future</strong> as we continue to move to an even more digitalized industry. <strong>But,</strong> beware of the few points I talked about,<strong> the increase in competition and lackluster work will be very real, and you will have to seek inspiration in unusual places and possibly fight harder for an average job.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are the biggest problems facing designers in the future?</h2>



<p>The world we are heading towards seems a much better place in many areas, <strong><a href="https://sagmeister.com/work/now-is-better-book/">Stefan Sagmeister’s new book put this into perspective for me,</a> </strong>and I’m excited about the possibilities that we will have when AI and other technologies such as <strong>virtual and augmented reality</strong> play a bigger role in our lives.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">I feel like designers will have a very important role in the successful communication of world issues that become either worse or less mentioned in media.</h4>



<p>A long time from now I believe<strong> traditional media will completely change</strong> alongside<strong> traditional advertising</strong> making designers rethink new ways to communicate.</p>



<p><strong>Motion will become an even bigger part of our day-to-day, infiltrating itself into all the design fields.</strong> Static content will either disappear or become a very point of focus.</p>



<p>Social media will reach a <strong>blow-up point </strong>and this is when a new formula will appear, as such <strong>we will have to readapt.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Typeface design and major typefaces will have to adapt</strong> as we move to an age of further developed augmented and virtual reality.</p>



<p>We are eventually going to reach a point in which the <strong>current brutalist and maximalist trends will disappear in favor of a much more depurated approach</strong> from the days of designers such as <strong>Massimo Vignelli.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What does the future look like for graphic designers?</h2>



<p>To me the future looks bright,<strong> I do believe traditional graphic design will change,</strong> perhaps our work category will change definitely to <strong>communication designer</strong> or<strong> visual designer, </strong>we already see a lot of these terms being used frequently.</p>



<p>Subsequently, education in design will change, and a <strong>focus on motion, product, and digital design </strong>seems to be an obvious update to the standard curriculum. </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Perhaps the introduction of terms such as innovation in design or human-to-human design will become classes.</h4>



<p>With the constant development of technology, <strong>we face exciting new challenges every day,</strong> it will be our role like those who came before<strong> to adapt to a new age.</strong></p>



<p>I’m excited to see the future of design and although it will, to me, be more competitive it will also create <strong>interesting new opportunities</strong> to communicate.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">On a final note, this article is very speculative but it was written to kickstart an important conversation</h2>



<p>As people involved in this industry, we need to be able to start and maintain conversations about the future. <strong>Get involved.</strong></p>

<p>As per usual I would love to see what your suggestions for essential books are! Eventually, I would love to write another article on this topic, so <strong>send me your suggestions</strong> and they may be featured next time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Vignelli Canon</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/vignellicanon-1024x682.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-208" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/vignellicanon-1024x682.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/vignellicanon-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/vignellicanon-768x511.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/vignellicanon.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<p>Written by the late iconic designer Massimo Vignelli, <strong>“The Vignelli Canon”</strong> is in my opinion of the most important design books ever made. It serves as a guide to the principles of what good design is while at the same time giving us incredible <strong>insights</strong> into Vignelli’s <strong>thought process, methodology, and philosophy.</strong></p>



<p>From the iconic list of 6 typefaces, I talked about in my <a href="/these-are-the-only-6-typefaces-you-need/"><strong>last article</strong></a> to the core ideas behind his designs, this book serves almost as a<strong> bible for anyone looking to become a designer.</strong></p>



<p>In an age where we are seeing more and more minimalist work being produced for the sake of being minimalist or style trends bringing back brutalism and maximalism, <strong>“The Vignelli Canon”</strong> is a nice reminder of what design isn’t and what it should be.</p>



<p>I truly believe everyone would love to read the lessons in this book, it is available to be bought <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vignelli-Canon-Massimo/dp/3037782250/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2YODJL2ULJC05&amp;keywords=vignelli+canon&amp;qid=1699020710&amp;sprefix=vignelli+canon%252Caps%252C146&amp;sr=8-1&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=hugosnotes-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=11ef91bc8d64483a31632b5eeabf7d0d&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325"><strong>here</strong></a> or totally free to download <a href="https://www.rit.edu/vignellicenter/sites/rit.edu.vignellicenter/files/documents/The%20Vignelli%20Canon.pdf"><strong>here.</strong></a> Amazingly, this book is<strong> completely free</strong> being yet another small detail that gives us a glimpse of the <strong>type of individual Vignelli was.</strong></p>



<p>Doing the research for this article I also came across <a href="https://soundcloud.com/designmatters/massimo-vignelli"><strong>this episode of the podcast Design Matters with Debbie Milman,</strong></a> although it was released 10 years ago, this episode still holds up and personally, I believe you will find a lot of value in it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Stop Stealing Sheep Find How Type Works</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/stopstealingsheep-1024x682.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-209" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/stopstealingsheep-1024x682.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/stopstealingsheep-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/stopstealingsheep-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/stopstealingsheep.jpg 1061w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<p>As a total fanboy, I really like this book written by also legendary designer and typographer <strong>Erik Spiekermann!</strong> &#8220;Stop Stealing Sheep Find How Type Works” is an <strong>incredible journey </strong>that leaves us understanding how important type is and how to use it.</p>



<p>This 4<sup>th</sup> edition is<strong> updated with a new chapter on variable typefaces,</strong> several examples on how to effectively communicate with type, and a full selection of new typefaces used and referenced throughout the book.</p>



<p>Although it’s a compact book it encourages reading and I guarantee every time you open it up you will find and learn something new.</p>



<p>This book is available to be <a href="https://shop.p98a.com/products/p98a-find-out-how-type-works-by-erik-spiekermann-4th-edition"><strong>bought through Erik’s experimental type gallery P98A</strong></a> and its also available for free on <a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/fonts.google.com/en//knowledge/stop_stealing_sheep.pdf"><strong>Google Fonts,</strong></a> which is awesome!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Thinking with type</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/thinkingwithtype-1024x682.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-210" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/thinkingwithtype-1024x682.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/thinkingwithtype-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/thinkingwithtype-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/thinkingwithtype-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/thinkingwithtype.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<p>Do I have to say anything? Ellen Lupton’s iconic book <strong>“Thinking with Type”</strong> was released a long time ago but it still holds up as it is frequently updated by the author. Let’s be real your university probably had this book in their references and for a good reason!</p>



<p><strong>“Thinking with Type”</strong> is a comprehensive guide to topics such as font selection, spacing, grids, and layout design, providing practical advice and examples for designers.</p>



<p>I frequently find myself rereading this book and I learn something new every time!<strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Type-2nd-revised-expanded/dp/1568989695/ref=sr_1_1?crid=27GQHNNEFZ9VA&amp;keywords=thinking+with+type&amp;qid=1699020278&amp;sprefix=thinking+with+type%252Caps%252C151&amp;sr=8-1&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=hugosnotes-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=184a77f78f45bd64169dd654114b7bc4&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">You can acquire a copy here.</a></strong> Unfortunately, there isn’t a free copy of this book I can link to you, perhaps one day <strong>Google Fonts</strong> will collaborate with Ellen, <strong>that would be awesome!</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Logotype &amp; Symbol</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="667" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/logotype.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-211" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/logotype.jpg 1000w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/logotype-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/logotype-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>

<p>If you’re like me and many other designers in the world <strong>seeking inspiration and references is basically a part of our day-to-day routines.</strong> When we talk about branding projects<strong> having good references for inspiration that you can pull out at any time is also essential.</strong></p>



<p>While for many years the holy grail of logo reference has been a book called<strong> “Logo Modernism”</strong>, which is a mammoth of a book, today I want to tell you about the two alternatives <strong>“Logotype &amp; Symbol”.</strong></p>



<p>Like <strong>“Logo Modernism”</strong> these two books, which I personally think you should buy together, serve as a more digestible alternative. If you already own the mammoth you will find <strong>“Logotype &amp; Symbol”</strong> still useful as there isn’t much duplicated content between books.</p>



<p>Personally, I really like these and whenever I’m working on any kind of branding project, <strong>they are extremely useful,</strong> if you are in a team their size is also useful to share between people.</p>



<p>You can buy a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logotype-Mini-Michael-Evamy/dp/1780678576/ref=sr_1_1?crid=S5PBRRG10IKM&amp;keywords=logotype&amp;qid=1699020357&amp;sprefix=logotype%252Caps%252C149&amp;sr=8-1&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=hugosnotes-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=d39f843df91e04fd7ed6eece49de6566&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325"><strong>copy here,</strong></a> which allows you to choose between a physical or a digital copy which is also cool!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Book Block and The Book Cover</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="684" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/thebookblock-1024x684.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-212" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/thebookblock-1024x684.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/thebookblock-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/thebookblock-768x513.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/thebookblock.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<p>Last but not least a suggestion that I’m sure you will love. <strong>“The Book Block and The Book Cover”</strong> are perfect books for anyone looking to work on editorial design, they are incredibly useful tools.</p>



<p>Created by Portuguese studio <strong>itemzero</strong> they present, in a very straight to the point useful way the key ingredients needed to design a great publication.</p>



<p>Explaining different techniques with a plethora of variations <strong>this book is in my view essential for anyone working in the industry.</strong></p>



<p>Last but not least for my Portuguese audience it also is multilingual which is awesome. You can acquire a copy <strong><a href="https://shop.itemzero.com/products/the-book-block/">here</a>,</strong> they frequently have discounts so stay alert!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">On a final note, I hope you found these books useful and please remember to share your must-haves</h2>



<p>Today’s article was on the shorter side but I hope you truly found this information useful.</p>



<p>You can read the last article <strong><a href="/these-are-the-only-6-typefaces-you-need/">here</a>.</strong></p>



<p>Thank you for reading, stay safe and have fun!</p>

<p>In the current day and age of design we have <strong>thousands and thousands of typefaces to choose from,</strong> so in this article following the lessons of modernist designers like <strong>Massimo Vignelli,</strong> I’m going to tell you <strong>the only 6 typefaces you need and that are the basis of my collection.</strong></p>

<p>Hello designers, recently I’ve been rereading a few books and articles on typefaces, particularly the new <a href="https://www.neue.shop/fonts/neue-serie57"><strong>Neue series 57 made by Neue Type Foundry in collaboration with Erik Spiekermann.</strong></a> These books and articles made me think a lot about type design and how it has evolved so much over the years.</p>



<p>Particularly I’ve been also rereading the infamous <strong><a href="https://www.rit.edu/vignellicenter/sites/rit.edu.vignellicenter/files/documents/The%20Vignelli%20Canon.pdf">Vignelli canon written by Massimo Vignelli</a>,</strong> one of the most important designers in history. In the book Vignelli teaches us about his philosophy on design and <strong>shares with us</strong> his iconic list of the only <strong>6 typefaces you need,</strong> claiming that <strong>you can trash the rest.</strong></p>



<p>Rediscovering this made me think <strong>“Hmm would his list today be the same?”</strong> with the evolution of technology and design trends I imagine his list would also evolve with the times. The matter of the fact is <strong>it’s still a relevant list that all designers still talk about today!</strong></p>



<p>The way you should see this article is very simple – <strong>it’s my own view </strong>of what those 6 typefaces would be,<strong> not an updated Vignelli list,</strong> just my list.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">“In the new computer age the proliferation of typefaces and type manipulations represents a new level of visual pollution threating our culture. Out of thousands of typefaces, all we need are a few basic ones, and trash the rest. So come and see A Few Basic Typefaces” <em>– Massimo Vignelli</em></h2>



<p>In a nutshell here is Vignelli’s list:</p>



<ul>
<li>Garamond</li>



<li>Bodoni</li>



<li>Century Expanded</li>



<li>Futura</li>



<li>Times Roman</li>



<li>Helvetica</li>
</ul>



<p>This list in my view <strong>is still very viable</strong> but I don’t think a lot of these typefaces<strong> stand the test of time </strong>as good as they probably should, <strong>either they have been redesigned or there are just better options.</strong> <strong>Don’t take this opinion from just me,</strong> see what people like <strong>Erik Spiekermann</strong> think of <strong>Helvetica,</strong> probably the most iconic typeface ever made – <a href="https://spiekermann.com/en/helvetica-sucks/"><strong>“Helvetica sucks. It really wasn’t designed for small sizes on screens. Words like milliliter can be very difficult to decipher.”</strong></a></p>



<p>To me these 6 typefaces <strong>lack features that most designers need today,</strong> I’m not saying I can put together a better list, but <strong>here is my attempt:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/EB+Garamond?query=eb+garamond"><strong>Eb Garamond</strong></a></li>



<li><a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bodoni+Moda?query=bodoni+moda"><strong>Bodoni Moda</strong></a></li>



<li><a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display"><strong>Playfair Display</strong></a></li>



<li><a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?query=poppins"><strong>Poppins</strong></a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.edenspiekermann.com/insights/mozilla-fira-fox/"><strong>Fira Sans</strong></a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.fontshare.com/fonts/switzer"><strong>Switzer</strong></a></li>
</ul>



<p>A small note if you have your own list please tell me about it in the comment section, <strong>I would love to know!</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Eb Garamond</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="500" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ebgaramond.png" alt="" class="wp-image-200" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ebgaramond.png 1000w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ebgaramond-300x150.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ebgaramond-768x384.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>



<p>Made as a <strong>revival of Claude Garamond’s original 1532 typeface,</strong> which is present on Vignelli’s list, this version was made for the digital age. The source for the letterforms comes from a scan of the <strong>“Berner Specimen”</strong> composed in 1592 by Conrad Berner.</p>



<p>Its letterforms are <strong>elegant and well-proportioned,</strong> striking a balance between classic aesthetics and modern legibility, making it <strong>suitable for various applications, including body text and headings.</strong></p>



<p>EB Garamond is versatile, offering different weights and styles.<strong> It&#8217;s also an open-source typeface!</strong></p>



<p>With an extensive character set, it supports various characters and diacritics, making it suitable for multilingual projects. <strong>Its attention to detail during the revival and refinement process ensures a high-quality typeface with consistent design features. </strong>EB Garamond works well in both print and digital contexts, thanks to its design that maintains its elegance and legibility in various sizes and applications.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Why is this typeface on my list?</h4>



<p>Like <strong>Vignelli</strong> it made sense to me to include Garamond although in my case a more updated version of it, <strong>it’s a perfect typeface for a variety of uses,</strong> it has a lower contrast between strokes but it exhibits a classic timeless design.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bodoni Moda</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="500" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/bodonimoda.png" alt="" class="wp-image-199" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/bodonimoda.png 1000w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/bodonimoda-300x150.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/bodonimoda-768x384.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>



<p>On the same line as EB Garamond Bodoni Moda is also a <strong>revival for the digital age </strong>designed by Owen Earl. It&#8217;s a <strong>contemporary reinterpretation of the classic Bodoni typeface loved by Vignelli, </strong>originally created by the Italian typographer Giambattista Bodoni in the late 18th century. The typeface&#8217;s historical connection gives it a touch of <strong>timeless sophistication,</strong> making it a suitable choice for a range of design applications.</p>



<p>One of Bodoni Moda&#8217;s key strengths is its <strong>high contrast between thick and thin strokes,</strong> which is a hallmark of the Bodoni style. This contrast gives the typeface a <strong>distinct and striking appearance</strong> that works exceptionally well for headlines, titles, and other display text. <strong>The sharp, geometric letterforms contribute to a sense of refinement and modernity.</strong></p>



<p>Bodoni Moda is available in various weights and styles, making it versatile for different design projects. The typeface&#8217;s versatility extends to its ability to be used in both print and digital media. <strong>Its clean and precise design ensures that it remains legible and aesthetically pleasing, even at small text sizes.</strong></p>



<p>It is an excellent choice for projects that require a blend of classic elegance and modern sophistication.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Why is this typeface on my list?</h4>



<p>I love Bodoni Moda, besides being a great revival t<strong>he contrasts in each letterform gives it a sharp, refined look.</strong> It’s a perfect companion for EB Garamond and should be in your collection.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Playfair Display</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="500" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/playfairdisplay.png" alt="" class="wp-image-197" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/playfairdisplay.png 1000w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/playfairdisplay-300x150.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/playfairdisplay-768x384.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>



<p>Playfair Display is an<strong> elegant and versatile typeface with a distinct historical charm.</strong> It was inspired by the work of John Baskerville, a renowned 18th-century typographer. This historical association imparts a <strong>timeless and classic quality </strong>to Playfair Display, making it an excellent choice for a wide range of design projects.</p>



<p>One of the key strengths of Playfair Display is like Bodoni Moda <strong>its combination of high contrast between thick and thin strokes and the graceful, well-proportioned letterforms.</strong> This balance between classic aesthetics and modern readability makes it a versatile choice suitable for both body text and headings. The typeface manages to strike a <strong>harmonious equilibrium </strong>between the two, making it a perfect option for projects that require a touch of sophistication.</p>



<p>Playfair Display comes in various styles and weights, offering flexibility for different design needs.<strong> This versatility ensures that it can be used effectively for a variety of applications,</strong> from traditional print materials to contemporary web design.</p>



<p>Playfair Display&#8217;s appeal lies in its<strong> historical lineage, elegant high-contrast design, versatility, and open-source availability. </strong>It is a typeface that seamlessly blends classic aesthetics with modern readability.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Why is this typeface on my list?</h4>



<p>Although fairly similar to the previous two options Playfair Display is<strong> unique in the smaller details,</strong> I really like specific characters like the <strong>“Q” </strong>or the <strong>“r” </strong>and also the number selection. In conjunction with the previous two typefaces, <strong>it covers most of my serif needs.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Poppins</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="500" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/poppins.png" alt="" class="wp-image-198" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/poppins.png 1000w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/poppins-300x150.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/poppins-768x384.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>



<p>Poppins is a contemporary and adaptable typeface that combines a <strong>clean, sans-serif design with a touch of approachability and friendliness. </strong>It was designed by type designer Ninad Kale, with a focus on <strong>modernity and readability, </strong>making it a versatile choice for a wide range of design projects.</p>



<p>One of the key strengths of Poppins is its <strong>simplicity and legibility. </strong>The typeface features <strong>well-proportioned, straightforward letterforms that are easy to read,</strong> making it suitable for both body text and headings. Its design is crisp and clear, which is particularly well-suited for digital media and screen usage.</p>



<p>Poppins offers a variety of weights and styles. <strong>This diversity allows for flexibility in design,</strong> ensuring that it can be used effectively in a multitude of contexts, from web design to branding and print materials.</p>



<p>Poppins&#8217; appeal lies in its modern and approachable design, legibility, and versatility. <strong>It&#8217;s a typeface that seamlessly blends contemporary aesthetics with readability.</strong></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Why is this typeface on my list?</h4>



<p>I picked Poppins as an <strong>alternative to Futura, which I don’t like.</strong> To me Poppins is Futura with a more refined letterform design, it’s<strong> slightly more geometric</strong> but it <strong>shares the key qualities of Futura.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Fira Sans</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="500" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/firasans.png" alt="" class="wp-image-196" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/firasans.png 1000w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/firasans-300x150.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/firasans-768x384.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>



<p>Initially designed as a <strong>commission from Firefox to Edenspiekermann </strong>Fira Sans is a modern and adaptable sans-serif typeface designed by <strong>Erik Spiekermann and Ralph du Carrois.</strong> It was crafted taking as a base the well-known iconic <strong>FF Meta </strong>to provide a highly legible and functional option, making it a versatile choice for a variety of design projects.</p>



<p>One of the key strengths of Fira Sans is its <strong>exceptional legibility.</strong> The letterforms are<strong> clean, balanced, and well-proportioned,</strong> ensuring easy readability, which is crucial for body text, headings, and user interfaces. This makes Fira Sans an excellent choice for content across various mediums.</p>



<p>Fira Sans offers an extensive range of weights and styles, including regular, italic, bold, and condensed versions. This wide variety of options allows designers to tailor their typographic choices to fit the specific requirements of a project,<strong> from web design to branding and editorial layouts.</strong></p>



<p>Fira Sans&#8217;s appeal lies in its modern design, exceptional legibility, extensive weights and styles, and open-source availability.<strong> It is a versatile and reliable typeface</strong> that works well in a wide array of design applications.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Why is this typeface on my list?</h4>



<p>I really like Fira Sans, it’s one of my favorite typefaces and I still cannot believe it’s free and open-source. Designed by one of my favorite designers it’s a <strong>humanistic sans-serif typeface that fits the list really well, </strong>it’s one of the key elements I believe <strong>Vignelli’s list lacks.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Switzer</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="500" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/switzer.png" alt="" class="wp-image-195" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/switzer.png 1000w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/switzer-300x150.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/switzer-768x384.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>



<p>Inspired by<strong> neo-grotesk Swiss typefaces </strong>Switzer is a typeface designed by Indian Type Foundry. This modern interpretation translated to a modern geometric sans-serif that is very legible.</p>



<p>Like Fira Sans and Poppins, the key strength is its <strong>exceptional legibility and simplicity. </strong>The letterforms although geometric have a lot of character. <strong>Balanced, clean, and very straightforward </strong>Switzer is an <strong>essential typeface.</strong></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Why is this typeface on my list?</h4>



<p>In my opinion, this typeface solves the main issues I and many designers have with Helvetica, <strong>it has character but it still shares the key qualities of Helvetica.</strong> It’s a workhorse of a typeface completely free which is also incredible.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So, this was my list, with these 6 typefaces I believe most designers will have their needs covered. Compared to Vignelli’s list it actually is fairly similar although I’ve replaced one of the serifs for a humanistic sans-serif typeface which in my opinion, and for my work, was the missing ingredient!</h2>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What makes this list good?</h2>



<p><strong>Versatility</strong> was the key aspect when I was making this list, I wanted three serifs and three sans-serifs that <strong>were versatile but that at the same time covered the several aspects that make each category unique. </strong>When looking to<strong> Vignelli’s </strong>list and mine you can clearly see what I mean, both lists follow the same thought process.</p>



<p>I wanted to also include the most amount of <strong>variable and web-ready typefaces </strong>as I believe this type of technology is the future.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why have I chosen only free typefaces?</h2>



<p>Mainly because they are<strong> widely available and easier to integrate, </strong>but also because <strong>I don’t like the fact that I have to pay thousands for Helvetica when better, free typefaces are available. </strong>I don’t like the types of prices most foundries ask for a single individual font, as a student it bothered me.<strong> I’m really glad we live in a time and age where free typefaces are a lot of the times good or better than paid ones.</strong></p>



<p>In the future, I hope projects like <strong>Google Fonts </strong>or <strong>Adobe Fonts </strong>continue to make proper efforts to support type designers and provide great typefaces for free. I will also always support foundries that make great typefaces open-source, free, or adequately priced. <strong>You’re awesome!</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">On a final note, let me remind you that mine or Vignelli’s list are just a basis, you can and should always expand on it and search for better alternatives.</h2>



<p>Even if you look at Vignelli’s work you will see other typefaces, for example, the Ducati logo he designed uses Univers. So<strong> be open to new horizons and support type designers and small foundries</strong> whenever you can!</p>



<p>Thank you for reading, as per usual I would love to read your opinion.</p>

<p>Music is great, no doubt about that, and in this article, <strong>I want to explore some of my favorite album covers and what I learned from them as a designer.</strong> I have such a huge love for music I can’t even describe it, it’s just such a huge part of who I am! So obviously when looking for inspiration out there I always love to look at new and old album covers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/oleg-ivanov-7x4ngEfelyE-unsplash-1024x683.jpg" alt="Photo of a person filliping through vinyls at a store" class="wp-image-134" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/oleg-ivanov-7x4ngEfelyE-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/10/oleg-ivanov-7x4ngEfelyE-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/10/oleg-ivanov-7x4ngEfelyE-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/10/oleg-ivanov-7x4ngEfelyE-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/10/oleg-ivanov-7x4ngEfelyE-unsplash-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<p><strong>What kind of music do you listen to while you work? </strong>For me it’s always something kind of relaxing but with a good beat so it helps me to focus. </p>



<p>As I’m writing this I’m listening to <strong>Daft Punk</strong> albums because I’ve been having this huge nostalgia trip, and I’m such a huge fan of the robots! <strong>Please do leave your favorite albums in the comments below, I would love to find new music to listen to!</strong></p>



<p>Anyways, with this article I want to dive into some of my <strong>favorite albums,</strong> talking about their cover designs and how I’ve used them as a learning tool for stuff like composition, color combinations, layout, etc. </p>



<p><strong>There is a lot we can learn from our day-to-day activities</strong> and as designers it’s basically essential that you look at everything with an eagle eye. Sometimes I find myself analyzing a weird milk carton or something random and there’s a lot to take away from these little things. </p>



<p>So, take this article as a <strong>call for action,</strong> look at stuff around you with a designer approach and you will see what I’m talking about!</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">In a nutshell these will be the album covers I’m going to talk about:</h4>



<ul>
<li><strong>Daft Punk</strong> &#8211; Discovery</li>



<li><strong>Soundgarden </strong>&#8211; Badmotorfinger</li>



<li><strong>Code Orange</strong> &#8211; The Above</li>



<li><strong>The Black Keys</strong> &#8211; Brothers</li>



<li><strong>Red Hot Chili Peppers</strong> &#8211; By the Way</li>
</ul>



<p>Also, a quick note, if you have any albums, you would love me to talk about, please leave a comment or write me an email, always open to suggestions!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Daft Punk &#8211; Discovery</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="592" height="600" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/R-2879-1236035472.jpg" alt="Discovery by Daft Punk album cover" class="wp-image-135" style="aspect-ratio:0.9866666666666667;width:750px;height:auto" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/R-2879-1236035472.jpg 592w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/10/R-2879-1236035472-296x300.jpg 296w" sizes="(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px" /></figure>



<p>Album Cover image from <a href="https://www.discogs.com/">Discogs</a></p>



<p>Released on <strong>March 12, 2001</strong> &#8211; Discovery is the second studio album by the iconic French duo<strong> Daft Punk.</strong> This album was a cornerstone for electronic music and a master class on sampling techniques. </p>



<p>It also had a movie released in 2003, serving as a visual companion for the album named <strong>“Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem”,</strong> this movie was animated by <strong>Toei Animation</strong>, and I would recommend you watch it and experience it.</p>



<p>To me this is <strong>one of my favorite albums of all time,</strong> it’s basically perfect and its album cover is incredibly iconic, I would even consider it a <strong>landmark</strong> of pop culture.</p>



<p>The previous album Homework also had such an interesting cover which like Discovery’s is a <strong>photograph!</strong> Yeah, I was also mind blown!</p>



<p>The Daft Punk logo which is also iconic, and the center piece of both albums was actually designed by <strong>Guy-Man</strong>, the gold robot. Although it may look 3d it actually isn’t this album cover was done using liquid metal by photographer <strong><a href="https://www.mitch.fr/">Mitch Feinberg.</a></strong></p>



<p>Unfortunately, I couldn’t really find a lot of information around about the exact process, but <strong>I sent an email to Mitch to try and figure it out.</strong> </p>



<p>If I learn anything new from him, <strong>I will write an article about it!</strong></p>



<p>There is a lot we can learn from this cover, but my <strong>main takeaway</strong> is that we should try and find ways to do our work more physically, nowadays we are bound to technology, and although it’s awesome that we have ways of doing stuff that we didn’t had 20 years ago sometimes <strong>being out there experimenting with materials and different processes of what we are used to, may translate in a very interesting result </strong>that we were not expecting.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Soundgarden &#8211; Badmotorfinger</h2>

<p>Album Cover image from <a href="https://www.discogs.com/">Discogs</a></p>



<p>Badmotorfinger is such an iconic album, released on October 8, 1991, by <strong>Soundgarden</strong> it quickly became an historic part of the grunge movement.</p>



<p>What makes the cover of this album so cool is the <strong>typography and the color combinations</strong>. I absolutely love it and I think you and I can learn a lot from it. </p>



<p>Red, yellow and purple are three colors that don’t make much sense but when put together they just work.</p>



<p>The main takeaway is to<strong> experiment with color and overall composition of elements,</strong> sometimes we tend to get stuck with grids or formulas that we have learned, and we could experiment and get amazing results. </p>



<p><strong>Formulas are good but sometimes we need to explore beyond them.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Code Orange – The above</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="599" height="546" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/R-28429588-1697995453-7695.jpg" alt="The Above by Code Orange Album Cover" class="wp-image-138" style="aspect-ratio:1.0970695970695972;width:750px;height:auto" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/R-28429588-1697995453-7695.jpg 599w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/10/R-28429588-1697995453-7695-300x273.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px" /></figure>



<p>Album Cover image from <a href="https://www.discogs.com/">Discogs</a></p>



<p>First, let me say I love <strong>Code Orange,</strong> if you haven’t listened to their stuff check it out. I was a huge fan of their older album cover designs. </p>



<p><strong>Bold colors, bold typography it just worked.</strong></p>



<p>I think The Above was a nice <strong>improvement</strong> on their formula for album cover design and the overall vinyl set looks awesome.</p>



<p>I really think<strong> composition</strong> is a big takeaway from this cover, the focus on the image and the overall graphic treatment is also a very interesting point.</p>



<p>What I takeaway from this is that we sometimes avoid using simple compositions, but <strong>this album turns a very simple composition which is very effective and levels it up with the graphic treatmen</strong>t. So don’t be afraid of using effective more simple compositions, embrace white space and experiment with effects/digital treatment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Black Keys &#8211; Brothers</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="600" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/R-2284952-1626530490-7581.jpg" alt="Brothers by The Black Keys Album Cover" class="wp-image-139" style="aspect-ratio:1;width:750px;height:auto" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/R-2284952-1626530490-7581.jpg 600w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/10/R-2284952-1626530490-7581-300x300.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/10/R-2284952-1626530490-7581-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure>



<p>Album Cover image from <a href="https://www.discogs.com/">Discogs</a></p>



<p>Brothers is the sixth studio album of <strong>The Black Keys </strong>released on May 18, 2010. This album cover became an instant classic, red, black, white and Cooper Black – <strong>what more could we ask for!</strong></p>



<p>I really do think it’s perhaps one of the<strong> most iconic albums covers of the 2010s,</strong> alongside AM by <strong>Artic </strong>Monkeys. Albums that just embraced simplicity and showed that sometimes less is more.</p>



<p>If you must take any album here and use it as an example of what an iconic album cover can look like I would recommend Brothers. Again, the same points I previously mentioned apply here, composition, color, typography, embracing white space. <strong>Do I need to say more?</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Red Hot Chili Peppers – By the way</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="600" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/R-1162737-1197254678.jpg" alt="By the Way by The Red Hot Chili Peppers Album Cover" class="wp-image-140" style="aspect-ratio:1;width:750px;height:auto" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/R-1162737-1197254678.jpg 600w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/10/R-1162737-1197254678-300x300.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/10/R-1162737-1197254678-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure>



<p>Album Cover image from <a href="https://www.discogs.com/">Discogs</a></p>



<p>Arguably my favorite band, I just had to mention them. Their eighth studio album <strong>By the Way </strong>was released July 9, 2002.</p>



<p>I talked about breaking formulas before and experimentation, but I really do think the By the Way album cover is probably one of the best examples of this. <strong>It’s incredibly expressive and features a very interesting typography treatment too.</strong></p>



<p>If had to take any lesson from it, it would be the same that I took from Discovery, <strong>to experiment with materials, get away from the computer and try stuff out.</strong> I don’t really like to paint or draw but sometimes we need to get uncomfortable to create unique stuff.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">On a final note, the main takeaways here are to experiment with design elements, get uncomfortable, less is more, formulas are good and sometimes breaking them is also good.</h2>



<p>This is about it, I know this wasn’t very extensive, this was as I said in the beginning to just make the point that you should look at things differently and take lessons from them.</p>

<p>If you are reading this hello there! <strong>My name is Hugo </strong>and this is the first ever article I am writing for my blog. Writing isn’t easy, as a matter of fact, I haven’t actively written anything in ages, well at least in a longer format and not notes in my notebook. With this in mind hopefully I can take you through my blogging origin story and explain why I started and <strong>how you can start right now!</strong> A question for sure arises to you fellow reader –<strong> why?</strong> Well, this isn’t exactly the easiest question to answer but my answer can be scaled down to one simple fact – <strong>I am a dreamer!</strong> </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large wp-duotone-unset-1"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/nick-morrison-FHnnjk1Yj7Y-unsplash-1024x768.jpg" alt="a laptop and a cup on a table with the purpose of showing what your setup could be as someone starting their blog right now" class="wp-image-101" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/nick-morrison-FHnnjk1Yj7Y-unsplash-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/10/nick-morrison-FHnnjk1Yj7Y-unsplash-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/10/nick-morrison-FHnnjk1Yj7Y-unsplash-768x576.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/10/nick-morrison-FHnnjk1Yj7Y-unsplash-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/10/nick-morrison-FHnnjk1Yj7Y-unsplash-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">In this article you are going to learn a little about the person behind the project &#8211; basically I&#8217;ll tell you why I started my blogging journey and how you can start yours!</h4>



<p>My name as I previously mentioned is <strong>Hugo Carvalho</strong> and I’m a graphic designer from Portugal. Although I’m still at the very beginning of my career I’ve already had incredible experiences thanks to the fact I was always involved with <strong>volunteering</strong> and activist organizations from a very young age.</p>



<p>My passion for volunteering and changing the world is as old as my passion for <strong>design</strong>, so it only makes sense<strong> I believe I can join both</strong> in one way or another.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Like father like son</h2>



<p>I think a big part of telling you my blogging and personal story is related to the relationship I have with my dad –<strong> he’s awesome!</strong> </p>



<p>Although not present in most of childhood he was and is a great parent, example and leader, he was the one who initially years ago <strong>made me want to become a designer</strong>, although to be honest at the time I didn’t knew it at all. </p>



<p>Let me explain &#8211; my father has worked for the biggest printers in Portugal such as Lidergraf and Naveprinter as one of the very best printers they had.</p>



<p>So as the story goes, one day my mom decided to take me to visit my dad late at work and this was basically <strong>officially the first time I fell in love with design</strong> as he showed me the huge rolls of paper, proofs of what he was printing, pantone reference books and of course the magnifying lens they use for proofing the projects.</p>



<p>Looking back to it now as I’m writing this it’s funny how life has turned out and how we basically have a bunch of topics to talk about and we even could work together at the same company. It’s truly as the saying goes – <strong>like father like son</strong>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The boy who dreamed</h2>



<p>I’m such a huge dreamer and I’m not telling you this lightly <strong>I truly have a big relationship with dreaming.</strong> </p>



<p>It makes me happy knowing that even if I can’t sometimes make all my dreams happen, I still continue to push new dreams into the equation,<strong> it’s a big part of who I am and what defines me.</strong></p>



<p>When I was young, I would frequently imagine the world in the future, besides the fact that I thought flying cars would be around already I also dreamt about a different society than what we have now. A <strong>fairer, more equal world</strong> where humans would co-exist – no wars, no homelessness, no discrimination.</p>



<p>Perhaps I dreamt and still dream too high but, in many ways, I hope to die knowing the world that little Hugo imagined was not just a mere dream.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why Design = Change</h2>



<p>One of my goals as a <strong>designer who cares about the world </strong>that surrounds him is to show that design has changed the world and can change the world, making it a better place. Although this isn’t the main reason why I’ve started this blog it hopefully helps to explain my thought process.</p>



<p><strong>Design = Change</strong> is eventually one of my ultimate long-term dreams turned goals that I see culminating in a book about design for social change, the blog definitely helps with my writing situation but this is a long-term idea and concept that I want to explore.</p>



<p>So hopefully now that you know<strong> </strong>a part of<strong> my story</strong> you can see what I mean and expand upon this concept in your own blogging story, but I still have to explain you why I started and how you can start right now &#8211; stay tuned!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why I began a blog?</h2>



<p>Well now we are reaching to an interesting part of my blogging story, so let me tell you how I started so we can get to the good part where I tell you how you can start <strong>right now!</strong> </p>



<p>Recently I finished my bachelor’s degree in graphic design and after trying and failing to move to another country and get into a design agency (I will release an article about this one day) I stayed in Portugal and I’m now doing a nine-month internship in a multinational company at their marketing department, alongside this I’m kickstarting my own design studio (it&#8217;s still in early development).</p>



<p>This blog is in many ways a way for me to <strong>express myself</strong>, to <strong>share my struggles</strong>, to <strong>inspire</strong> and hopefully one day to <strong>achieve a certain level of establishment</strong> like the designers I respect and are inspired by. Hey maybe one day I’m even invited to talk at a TED talk or an event – <strong>the sky isn’t the limit for this dreamer!</strong></p>



<p>Also in a day and age where short-form copy paste mindless boring content is the mainstream on social media and other platforms, <strong>writing a blog feels truly refreshing.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How I started and how you start a blog now</h2>



<p>Do you want to start your own blog? Don’t worry this is going to be my <strong>nonsense guide on how the hell I figured this out </strong>so the only thing stopping you from writing a blog about your mom’s cookies online is yourself, also a disclaimer, I’m not talking about stuff that you can easily watch in one of the videos I’m going to link bellow like “How to make a website with WordPress”.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">First you will need to figure out two easy things</h4>



<ul>
<li>Figure out what you want to talk about</li>



<li>Figure out if you are using a platform for blogs or if you are making it from scratch</li>
</ul>



<p>Figuring out what you are going to talk about should be the easy first step,<strong> just write about something that excites you</strong>. You love to cook with your mom? Write about that! You love to walk your dog? Write about that! </p>



<p>It’s easy <strong>just find something you love and write about that</strong>, on my own case I knew I wanted to talk about design and stuff related about design because guess what, it’s what I love – easy.</p>



<p>Choosing a platform becomes the <strong>pain the ass</strong> to be honest thanks to the increasing variety of platforms that exist on the market, so it’s genuinely going to <strong>need some research on your part</strong> but here is a small compilation of my own process and conclusions.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.blogger.com/"><strong>Blogger</strong></a> if you want something incredibly easy but without much customization (also free if you don’t connect your own domain)</li>



<li><strong><a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a> </strong>as either your main option or something secondary where you import your blog posts to hopefully generate more traffic</li>



<li>Build your own website with a powerful CMS, you have thousands of options here from <a href="http://squarespace.com/"><strong>squarespace</strong></a> to <a href="http://wix.com/"><strong>wix</strong></a> to <a href="http://wordpress.com/"><strong>wordpress</strong></a>, it’s like the multiverse – infinite options.</li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">My current setup consists of a domain bought through <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/"><strong>cloudflare</strong></a> pointing towards a <a href="https://vrlps.co/edsm8ck/cp"><strong>cloudways</strong></a> server with a <a href="https://wordpress.org/"><strong>wordpress</strong></a> installation.</h5>



<p>I’m not going to touch on what plugins I’m using and stuff like that because wordpress is a <strong>build your own scenario</strong> platform so it doesn’t make sense.</p>



<p>Some notes on my setup though, first <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/"><strong>cloudflare</strong></a> has a small problem if you are on the completely free tier and you buy a domain with them – <strong>you cannot point to other nameservers.</strong> </p>



<p>This wasn’t a problem on my use case because I wanted to <strong>run my DNS towards <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">cloudflare</a> anyways </strong>but it excluded some web hosting providers that for some reason only were allowing me to add this domain if I changed my nameservers. </p>



<p>Second, this is probably not the cheapest solution but it works for me as I wanted to <strong>host two websites in the same server</strong>, my studio’s website which I haven’t made yet and my blog. Third<strong> I’m not a web developer</strong> so this setup probably isn’t the best – <strong>do your research!</strong></p>



<p>Also I’m using google analytics, google search console and <strong><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">cloudflare</a></strong> to analyze website performance and gmail’s API for the emails that get routed from the contact form (this was a pain to setup). In the future I’m also considering adding google ads in a non-intrusive way.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">On a final note, I just wanted to tell that<strong> I’m excited</strong> to write here and that you can of course expect me to keep you updated! More stuff about the studio coming soon!</h2>



<p>In terms of posting frequency, you can expect <strong>1 – 3 articles per week</strong>, sometimes more sometimes less, let’s go with the flow.</p>



<p>Also, if you want more content, please do consider checking out my <strong>social media</strong> platforms! Feel free to also leave a comment, I will try to read them all!</p>



<p>Thank you for reading, I hope you enjoyed my blogging story, understood how I started and hopefully got some motivation and knowledge on how you can start right now!</p>



<p>You can also contact me through <strong><a href="/contact/">here</a>!</strong> I&#8217;ll try to answer to emails as soon as possible!</p>
