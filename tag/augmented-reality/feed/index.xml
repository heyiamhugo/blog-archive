<p>In a world of constant change, <strong>the design industry is continuously evolving</strong>, with these changes <strong>we must also evolve </strong>so in this article I will talk about the <strong>key skill every designer needs to learn in 2024.</strong></p>

<p><a href="/what-does-the-future-of-design-look-like/"><strong>In my last article,</strong></a> I talked about my vision for the future of design and <strong>how we are very close to massive changes in the industry.</strong> Out of the several things I wrapped my head around one stood out to me the most – <strong>the future is motion.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Static is out, motion is in</h2>



<p>Over the last few years motion design undoubtedly has taken the world by storm, if we take a close look at the last 10 years, <strong>motion design has steadily, alongside UI/UX, become an increasingly important area of design.</strong></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">From TV to smartphones to ads on the street, everything nowadays is slowly becoming less static. The new possibilities in terms of technology have been increasing the types of supports we can use motion in, to me motion will be a part of every designer’s skillset in a few years.</h4>



<p>In many ways,<strong> when we look at the world that surrounds us,</strong> more and more, <strong>we see static formats slowly disappearing. </strong>An example of this in Portugal recently has been the introduction of digital Mupis on bus stops.</p>



<p>What was once a place for a <strong>completely static poster</strong> is now basically a <strong>digital playground for motion design.</strong> This is just an example, but many more places are suffering these types of changes, from the introduction of the e-book to televisions replacing static posters in movie theaters, e<strong>verything is changing to become less static.</strong></p>



<p><strong>I challenge you to take a look around you</strong> and identify these small details in our day-to-day activities, you will most likely see different examples than the one I previously mentioned, <strong>you just need to keep your eyes wide open.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The evolution of software and hardware</h2>



<p>Like the Mupis I was talking about technology in general has improved dramatically over the years. <strong>We are lucky to be a part of one of the most interesting generations ever.</strong></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">If you took a look at the world 25 years ago it was a vastly different place in terms of technology, forget your high res Tv, your laptop, your smartphone, your high-speed internet connection and bring back the CRTs, the Nokia phones, the dial-up internet and all the other marvels of late 90s technology.</h4>



<p>My point is – <strong>there has been a dramatic change in technology in a very short time frame.</strong> Although nowadays its starting to slow down a bit <strong>the evolution of technology is as obvious as my name being Hugo.</strong></p>



<p>Over the last few years, a lot of these technological revolutions have turned out to be related to <strong>finding new ways of implementing screens into your life.</strong> Making them <strong>cheaper and easier to make</strong> has only translated into the <strong>propagation of screens to almost everything we use</strong> that involves some type of technology.</p>



<p>In the future Motion Design will be important as we move to an <strong>era of new supports</strong> like augmented and virtual reality, but also as we move to an era of <strong>full/increasing replacement of static media.</strong></p>



<p><strong>The world of advertising and media is already changing by the clock so we must evolve and adapt with the times. </strong>Accepting that motion is going to be a big part of your life is the first step.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The new age of social media</h2>



<p>Remember good old <strong>MSN,</strong> no? What about <strong>Hi5?</strong> Hey, do you even remember<strong> Facebook?</strong></p>



<p>It’s very strange how social media platforms have been changing over the years, but one thing that isn’t strange to me is <strong>how every single one of them started to get some type of way of showing you videos</strong>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Instagram, X (rip Twitter), Facebook, TikTok, and others have one thing in common besides basically copying each other – the possibility of sharing videos.</h4>



<p>This fact <strong>single-handedly makes Motion Design even more important.</strong> If you want to stand out you can’t be static.</p>



<p>As we move into the future, platforms focused on video sharing seem to be slowly taking over,<strong> Motion Design in my eyes will play an essential role in the future of social media.</strong> Every brand, every product, everything really <strong>will seek to have motion attached to it.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Animation has never been more accessible</h2>



<p>On one side we have an <strong>ever-expanding industry</strong> only increasing in the future, on the other, <strong>we have software that has become easier to use.</strong> We don’t need the mess that was Flash animation, nowadays we have <strong>After-effects,</strong> several 3d and 2d animation software, and of course the incredible <a href="http://blender.org/"><strong>Blender.</strong></a></p>



<p>Thanks to <strong>YouTube, platforms like Skillshare, and School of Motion</strong> learning Motion Design has never been <strong>cheaper and more accessible.</strong></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">I have to say I really do like Blender, the community is incredible, and personally speaking, I see it taking over the industry standard Cinema 4D in the near future.</h4>



<p>The fact that a piece of software is so loved and remains free shows the type of people behind <strong>Blender </strong>and why it is<strong> the tool to learn </strong>if you are looking to learn 3D and animation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/untitled-1024x576.png" alt="3d image of a credit card mockup" class="wp-image-219" style="width:750px;height:auto" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/untitled-1024x576.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/untitled-300x169.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/untitled-768x432.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/untitled-1536x864.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/untitled.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Cool Credit Card Mockup I made in Blender (I still have to figure out the whole animation thing)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why is motion design a key skill that every designer needs to learn in 2024?</h2>



<p>Last but not least on my to-talk list is the answer to the starting question of this article. <strong>It’s a key skill every designer should learn because motion design has never been easier and more important in our industry.</strong></p>



<p>Recently award-winning agencies such as <a href="http://studiodumbar.com/"><strong>Studio Dumbar</strong></a> and <a href="http://wolffolins.com/"><strong>Wolff Olins</strong></a> have been releasing successful project after successful project. The <strong>one key ingredient </strong>almost every project they share has in common is <strong>motion.</strong></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">If you look at these agencies motion stands almost as a core component in every single project and its no coincidence that they have become two of the most popular agencies in the world.</h4>



<p>So, I suggest you <em>look </em><strong>around you, accept motion and work on your skillset, </strong>because believe me this will become the future.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">On a final note, here are a few suggestions if you want to get started with motion design</h2>



<ul>

</ul>



<p>Although on the shorter side, <strong>I do hope this article has at least made you interested in motion, </strong>don’t forget to leave a comment below I’m interested to read your opinions.</p>



<p>Think different. Make difference.</p>

<p>Hello designers, <strong>how many of us think about the future a lot?</strong> I know I do, it&#8217;s probably a personal thing but thinking about the future is something I do quite often. Lately, my head has been contemplating <strong>the future of our field,</strong> particularly after I listened to the <a href="https://www.creativeboom.com/podcast/stefan-sagmeister/"><strong>99<sup>th</sup> episode of the Creative Boom Podcast with Stefan Sagmeister.</strong></a> (Highly recommend it)</p>



<p>In this article <strong>I’m not answering to “What does the future of design look like?”</strong> but instead to start a conversation. So, if you feel like it <strong>leave a comment below!</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The current state of design</h2>



<p>Design today has suffered many changes, <strong>we live in a mostly digital age,</strong> and as such <strong>the supports we play with are vastly different.</strong> To me, it&#8217;s interesting to look around and see <strong>different technologies coexist,</strong> you can read a newspaper physically or do it on your phone, and the same for books and many other types of mediums, even other types of products have changed – for example Car UI, <strong>you can drive a 90s car without barely any type of UI or drive the latest generation of cars with <a href="https://www.edenspiekermann.com/whitepaper/how-to-design-in-car-ux-that-doesnt-suck/">incredibly designed car UI.</a></strong> This coexistence is very interesting to me, and I think when I look at the current state of design it&#8217;s interesting the vast types of mediums we have at our disposal.</p>



<p>Design today has fundamentally changed, when we look at history,<strong> we see how it has evolved from a discipline that no one knew to one of the biggest fields of study</strong> <strong>in the world.</strong> Obviously, this also translated into an <strong>increase in competition.</strong></p>



<p>However, a <strong>side-effect </strong>related to the evolution of technology is how it has become <strong>more accessible. </strong>Thanks to the dawn of the internet era and the development of software, <strong>what was once a specialized area filled with few but incredibly talented people has now become an increasingly competitive field with a lot of untalented unknowledgeable people producing lackluster work.</strong></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Imagine if suddenly a bunch of courses and tools were invented and introduced to make a doctor’s job easier but as a consequence, everyone thought that just by learning how to clean a wound they instantly could become a doctor. That’s how the landscape of design is today.</h4>



<p>Although a bit exaggerated, I’ve created this comparison as a <strong>way to explain to you my view</strong> on a lot of design projects and people. <strong>I don’t have anything against it, but it creates a lot of problems, </strong>particularly the devaluation of a designer’s job.</p>



<p>The most recent innovation that was talked about by everyone and created a lot of buzz in several industries without a doubt has been AI, <strong>probably the biggest creation in the last 10 years.</strong></p>



<p>In design AI created kind of a panic, we saw a lot of the people previously mentioned feel threatened and a lot of businesses replacing design and marketing teams at a very fast rate. But one has to ask, <strong>is this a bad thing?</strong> I will talk about this a bit later but to me, it isn’t such a big problem.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Looking into the past to project the future</h2>



<p>I think its <strong>very smart to look into the past to project the future,</strong> this is even more valid when we talk about technology.</p>



<p>Remember about the<strong> buzz </strong>when <strong>personal computers</strong> were first introduced? <strong>It completely changed the design landscape,</strong> what once took <strong>hours to do through tedious analog processes,</strong> was now <strong>possible to do with a few clicks,</strong> without you having to get your hands dirty. <strong>Isn’t this the same with AI?</strong></p>



<p>AI like personal computers <strong>scared a lot of people</strong> but in my view in the near future<strong> it will become a nearly invaluable piece of technology</strong> for many people’s lives. Even software manufacturers have already adapted to the times starting to offer a lot of AI based tools, like for example <strong>Photoshop’s generative AI tool.</strong></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Like the personal computer or the internet, a lot of people freaked out with AI but eventually, those who accept these tools grow to outdo their colleagues who don’t. </h4>



<p>So, I’m not saying that you should use AI but be smart and look into it, so like many designers in the past who didn’t you don’t fall into oblivion.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Will AI replace designers?</h2>



<p>Throughout this article, I’ve pretty much given my opinion on AI and how it’s affecting the world but the top question is <strong>if it’s going to replace us?</strong></p>



<p>In my humble opinion it will replace a lot of work that you didn’t want to be involved in, <strong>a lot of clients who want cheap solutions</strong> that know nothing about design probably will use AI.</p>



<p>The clients who realize design is a<strong> human based field that creates products for human based clients </strong>will dismiss AI. This is already happening but I do believe it will only increase in the future.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Inherently this means, less bad-quality clients, more people interested in your services, more competition, and probably more money.</h4>



<p>So those who are good will <strong>undoubtedly stand out </strong>against a plethora of average unhuman work.</p>



<p>In the future<strong> AI will only replace bad clients,</strong> <strong>not good quality designers</strong> who take clients through an extensive process that culminates in the final result. At the end of the day,<strong> design is very human and the end product is for humans so replacement by AI isn’t an option</strong> for those who are serious about their business.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Is design a good career for the future?</h2>



<p>Honestly, I feel <strong>praise for good designers will only increase </strong>as we move to an age of <strong>pure digital trash.</strong></p>



<p>The more you look into developing your <strong>design skills and soft-skills</strong> the better. </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Soft-skills in particular will be increasingly more important. The more you understand your client, and the more you build a human-level relationship the better, particularly for the end product.</h4>



<p>I also expect <strong>designer salaries and project budgets </strong>will in general increase, <strong>alongside with the competition</strong> for a job position. This will be a direct consequence of lower-budget clients moving to AI-based tools.</p>



<p>In my view, <strong>design will be a good career for the future</strong> as we continue to move to an even more digitalized industry. <strong>But,</strong> beware of the few points I talked about,<strong> the increase in competition and lackluster work will be very real, and you will have to seek inspiration in unusual places and possibly fight harder for an average job.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are the biggest problems facing designers in the future?</h2>



<p>The world we are heading towards seems a much better place in many areas, <strong><a href="https://sagmeister.com/work/now-is-better-book/">Stefan Sagmeister’s new book put this into perspective for me,</a> </strong>and I’m excited about the possibilities that we will have when AI and other technologies such as <strong>virtual and augmented reality</strong> play a bigger role in our lives.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">I feel like designers will have a very important role in the successful communication of world issues that become either worse or less mentioned in media.</h4>



<p>A long time from now I believe<strong> traditional media will completely change</strong> alongside<strong> traditional advertising</strong> making designers rethink new ways to communicate.</p>



<p><strong>Motion will become an even bigger part of our day-to-day, infiltrating itself into all the design fields.</strong> Static content will either disappear or become a very point of focus.</p>



<p>Social media will reach a <strong>blow-up point </strong>and this is when a new formula will appear, as such <strong>we will have to readapt.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Typeface design and major typefaces will have to adapt</strong> as we move to an age of further developed augmented and virtual reality.</p>



<p>We are eventually going to reach a point in which the <strong>current brutalist and maximalist trends will disappear in favor of a much more depurated approach</strong> from the days of designers such as <strong>Massimo Vignelli.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What does the future look like for graphic designers?</h2>



<p>To me the future looks bright,<strong> I do believe traditional graphic design will change,</strong> perhaps our work category will change definitely to <strong>communication designer</strong> or<strong> visual designer, </strong>we already see a lot of these terms being used frequently.</p>



<p>Subsequently, education in design will change, and a <strong>focus on motion, product, and digital design </strong>seems to be an obvious update to the standard curriculum. </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Perhaps the introduction of terms such as innovation in design or human-to-human design will become classes.</h4>



<p>With the constant development of technology, <strong>we face exciting new challenges every day,</strong> it will be our role like those who came before<strong> to adapt to a new age.</strong></p>



<p>I’m excited to see the future of design and although it will, to me, be more competitive it will also create <strong>interesting new opportunities</strong> to communicate.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">On a final note, this article is very speculative but it was written to kickstart an important conversation</h2>



<p>As people involved in this industry, we need to be able to start and maintain conversations about the future. <strong>Get involved.</strong></p>
