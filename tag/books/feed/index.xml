<p>Hey everyone, lately I’ve been rereading a few design books that I have around, mainly because of this article. Today I hope to share with you the <strong>5 books</strong> that, in my opinion, <strong>should be on everyone’s shelves.</strong></p>

<p>As per usual I would love to see what your suggestions for essential books are! Eventually, I would love to write another article on this topic, so <strong>send me your suggestions</strong> and they may be featured next time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Vignelli Canon</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/vignellicanon-1024x682.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-208" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/vignellicanon-1024x682.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/vignellicanon-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/vignellicanon-768x511.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/vignellicanon.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<p>Written by the late iconic designer Massimo Vignelli, <strong>“The Vignelli Canon”</strong> is in my opinion of the most important design books ever made. It serves as a guide to the principles of what good design is while at the same time giving us incredible <strong>insights</strong> into Vignelli’s <strong>thought process, methodology, and philosophy.</strong></p>



<p>From the iconic list of 6 typefaces, I talked about in my <a href="/these-are-the-only-6-typefaces-you-need/"><strong>last article</strong></a> to the core ideas behind his designs, this book serves almost as a<strong> bible for anyone looking to become a designer.</strong></p>



<p>In an age where we are seeing more and more minimalist work being produced for the sake of being minimalist or style trends bringing back brutalism and maximalism, <strong>“The Vignelli Canon”</strong> is a nice reminder of what design isn’t and what it should be.</p>



<p>I truly believe everyone would love to read the lessons in this book, it is available to be bought <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vignelli-Canon-Massimo/dp/3037782250/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2YODJL2ULJC05&amp;keywords=vignelli+canon&amp;qid=1699020710&amp;sprefix=vignelli+canon%252Caps%252C146&amp;sr=8-1&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=hugosnotes-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=11ef91bc8d64483a31632b5eeabf7d0d&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325"><strong>here</strong></a> or totally free to download <a href="https://www.rit.edu/vignellicenter/sites/rit.edu.vignellicenter/files/documents/The%20Vignelli%20Canon.pdf"><strong>here.</strong></a> Amazingly, this book is<strong> completely free</strong> being yet another small detail that gives us a glimpse of the <strong>type of individual Vignelli was.</strong></p>



<p>Doing the research for this article I also came across <a href="https://soundcloud.com/designmatters/massimo-vignelli"><strong>this episode of the podcast Design Matters with Debbie Milman,</strong></a> although it was released 10 years ago, this episode still holds up and personally, I believe you will find a lot of value in it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Stop Stealing Sheep Find How Type Works</h2>

<p>As a total fanboy, I really like this book written by also legendary designer and typographer <strong>Erik Spiekermann!</strong> &#8220;Stop Stealing Sheep Find How Type Works” is an <strong>incredible journey </strong>that leaves us understanding how important type is and how to use it.</p>



<p>This 4<sup>th</sup> edition is<strong> updated with a new chapter on variable typefaces,</strong> several examples on how to effectively communicate with type, and a full selection of new typefaces used and referenced throughout the book.</p>



<p>Although it’s a compact book it encourages reading and I guarantee every time you open it up you will find and learn something new.</p>



<p>This book is available to be <a href="https://shop.p98a.com/products/p98a-find-out-how-type-works-by-erik-spiekermann-4th-edition"><strong>bought through Erik’s experimental type gallery P98A</strong></a> and its also available for free on <a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/fonts.google.com/en//knowledge/stop_stealing_sheep.pdf"><strong>Google Fonts,</strong></a> which is awesome!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Thinking with type</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/thinkingwithtype-1024x682.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-210" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/thinkingwithtype-1024x682.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/thinkingwithtype-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/thinkingwithtype-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/thinkingwithtype-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/thinkingwithtype.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<p>Do I have to say anything? Ellen Lupton’s iconic book <strong>“Thinking with Type”</strong> was released a long time ago but it still holds up as it is frequently updated by the author. Let’s be real your university probably had this book in their references and for a good reason!</p>



<p><strong>“Thinking with Type”</strong> is a comprehensive guide to topics such as font selection, spacing, grids, and layout design, providing practical advice and examples for designers.</p>



<p>I frequently find myself rereading this book and I learn something new every time!<strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Type-2nd-revised-expanded/dp/1568989695/ref=sr_1_1?crid=27GQHNNEFZ9VA&amp;keywords=thinking+with+type&amp;qid=1699020278&amp;sprefix=thinking+with+type%252Caps%252C151&amp;sr=8-1&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=hugosnotes-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=184a77f78f45bd64169dd654114b7bc4&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">You can acquire a copy here.</a></strong> Unfortunately, there isn’t a free copy of this book I can link to you, perhaps one day <strong>Google Fonts</strong> will collaborate with Ellen, <strong>that would be awesome!</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Logotype &amp; Symbol</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="667" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/logotype.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-211" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/logotype.jpg 1000w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/logotype-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/logotype-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>

<p>If you’re like me and many other designers in the world <strong>seeking inspiration and references is basically a part of our day-to-day routines.</strong> When we talk about branding projects<strong> having good references for inspiration that you can pull out at any time is also essential.</strong></p>



<p>While for many years the holy grail of logo reference has been a book called<strong> “Logo Modernism”</strong>, which is a mammoth of a book, today I want to tell you about the two alternatives <strong>“Logotype &amp; Symbol”.</strong></p>



<p>Like <strong>“Logo Modernism”</strong> these two books, which I personally think you should buy together, serve as a more digestible alternative. If you already own the mammoth you will find <strong>“Logotype &amp; Symbol”</strong> still useful as there isn’t much duplicated content between books.</p>



<p>Personally, I really like these and whenever I’m working on any kind of branding project, <strong>they are extremely useful,</strong> if you are in a team their size is also useful to share between people.</p>



<p>You can buy a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logotype-Mini-Michael-Evamy/dp/1780678576/ref=sr_1_1?crid=S5PBRRG10IKM&amp;keywords=logotype&amp;qid=1699020357&amp;sprefix=logotype%252Caps%252C149&amp;sr=8-1&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=hugosnotes-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=d39f843df91e04fd7ed6eece49de6566&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325"><strong>copy here,</strong></a> which allows you to choose between a physical or a digital copy which is also cool!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Book Block and The Book Cover</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="684" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/thebookblock-1024x684.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-212" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/thebookblock-1024x684.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/thebookblock-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/thebookblock-768x513.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/11/thebookblock.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<p>Last but not least a suggestion that I’m sure you will love. <strong>“The Book Block and The Book Cover”</strong> are perfect books for anyone looking to work on editorial design, they are incredibly useful tools.</p>



<p>Created by Portuguese studio <strong>itemzero</strong> they present, in a very straight to the point useful way the key ingredients needed to design a great publication.</p>



<p>Explaining different techniques with a plethora of variations <strong>this book is in my view essential for anyone working in the industry.</strong></p>



<p>Last but not least for my Portuguese audience it also is multilingual which is awesome. You can acquire a copy <strong><a href="https://shop.itemzero.com/products/the-book-block/">here</a>,</strong> they frequently have discounts so stay alert!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">On a final note, I hope you found these books useful and please remember to share your must-haves</h2>



<p>Today’s article was on the shorter side but I hope you truly found this information useful.</p>



<p>You can read the last article <strong><a href="/these-are-the-only-6-typefaces-you-need/">here</a>.</strong></p>



<p>Thank you for reading, stay safe and have fun!</p>
